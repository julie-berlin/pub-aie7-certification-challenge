    "question": "I recently received a call from a representative of a company that is bidding on a contract with our agency, and they asked if I would be interested in discussing a potential job opportunity with them after my work on the procurement is complete. I know that I need to report this contact to my supervisor and the designated agency ethics official, but I'm unsure about the next steps. Should I immediately reject the possibility of non-Federal employment, or can I wait until I receive guidance from the ethics official before making that decision? Additionally, how should I document this situation to ensure compliance with the ethics regulations?",

The accountant's private\nemployer, a large corporation, believes the job will enhance their skills and has agreed to give them a\ntwo-year unpaid leave of absence at the end of which they have agreed to return to work for the\ncorporation.

Any such determination will be based on a consideration of all the relevant\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.605(a) “Example 1 to paragraph (a)”\n5 CFR 2635.606(b) (enhanced display)\npage 53 of 90\n§ 2635.607 Notification requirements for public financial disclosure report filers regarding\nnegotiations for or agreement of future employment or compensation.\nfactors, including those listed in § 2635.502(d), and a determination that the concern that a reasonable\nperson may question the integrity of the agency's decision-making process outweighs the Government's\ninterest in the employee's participation in the particular matter.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission was relieved of\nresponsibility for an investigation of a broker-dealer while seeking employment with the law firm\nrepresenting the broker-dealer in that matter. The firm did not offer the partnership position the\nemployee sought. Even though the employee is no longer seeking employment with the firm, they\nmay continue to be recused from participating in the investigation based on a determination by the\nagency designee that the concern that a reasonable person might question whether, in view of the\nhistory of the employment negotiations, they could act impartially in the matter outweighs the\nGovernment's interest in their participation.\n(a)\nNotification regarding negotiations for or agreement of future employment or compensation. A public filer\nwho is negotiating for or has an agreement of future employment or compensation with a non-Federal\nentity must file a statement notifying an agency ethics official of such negotiation or agreement within\nthree business days after commencement of the negotiation or agreement. This notification statement\nmust be in writing, must be signed by the public filer, and must include the name of the non-Federal entity\ninvolved in such negotiation or agreement and the date on which the negotiation or agreement\ncommenced. When a public filer has previously complied with the notification requirement in this section\nregarding the commencement of negotiations, the filer need not file a separate notification statement\nwhen an agreement of future employment or compensation is reached with the previously identified non-\nFederal entity. There is also no requirement to file another notification when negotiations have been\nunsuccessful. However, employees may want to do so to facilitate the resumption of their duties.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Merit Systems Protection Board who is a public filer was in\nprivate practice prior to Government service. The employee receives a telephone call from a partner\nin a law firm who inquires as to whether they would be interested in returning to private practice.\nDuring this initial telephone call with the law firm partner, the employee indicates that they are\ninterested in resuming private practice. The partner and employee discuss generally the types of\nissues that would need to be agreed upon if the employee were to consider a possible offer to serve\nas “of counsel” with the firm, such as salary, benefits, and type of work the employee would perform.\nThe employee has begun negotiating for future employment with the law firm. Within three business\ndays after this initial telephone call, the employee must file written notification of the negotiations\nwith the agency ethics official.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): The employee in the example 1 to this paragraph (a) also negotiates a possible\ncontract with a publisher to begin writing a textbook after leaving Government service. Within three\nbusiness days after commencing negotiations, the employee must file written notification with the\nagency ethics official documenting this engagement in negotiations for future compensation with\nthe book publisher.\n(b)\nNotification of recusal. A public filer who files a notification statement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this\nsection must file with an agency ethics official a notification of recusal whenever there is a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of interest with the non-Federal entity identified in the notification\nstatement. The notification statement and the recusal statement may be contained in a single document\nor in separate documents.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch",
      "Example 3 to paragraph (a): A special Government employee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) is assigned to advise the FDIC on rules applicable to all member banks. The employee mails\nan unsolicited letter to a member bank offering services as a contract consultant. Although the\nemployee is seeking employment, the employee may participate in this particular matter of general\napplicability until receipt of some response indicating an interest in discussing the employment\nproposal. A letter merely acknowledging receipt of the proposal is not an indication of interest in\nemployment discussions.\nExample 4 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is\nconducting an inspection of one of several textile companies to which they sent an unsolicited\nresume. The employee may not participate personally and substantially in the inspection because\nthey are seeking employment and the inspection is a particular matter involving specific parties that\nwill affect the textile company.\n(b)\nNotification. Employees who become aware of the need to recuse from participating in a particular matter\nto which they have been assigned must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that they do not\nparticipate in the matter. Appropriate oral or written notification of their recusal may be made to an\nagency ethics official, coworkers, or a supervisor to document and help effectuate the recusal. Public\nfilers must comply with additional notification requirements set forth in § 2635.607.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is participating in the\naudit of a contract for laboratory support services. Before sending a resume to a lab which is a\nsubcontractor under the VA contract, the employee should recuse from participating in the audit.\nBecause the employee cannot withdraw from participating in the contract audit without supervisor\napproval, the employee should notify the supervisor of the need to recuse for ethics reasons so that\nappropriate adjustments in work assignments can be made.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.604(a)(2)(i)\n5 CFR 2635.604(b) “Example 1 to paragraph (b)” (enhanced display)\npage 51 of 90\n§ 2635.605 Waiver or authorization permitting participation while seeking employment.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is contacted in writing\nby a pharmaceutical company concerning possible employment with the company. The employee is\nreviewing an application from the same pharmaceutical company, which is seeking FDA approval for\na new drug product. Once the employee makes a response that is not a rejection to the company's\ncommunication concerning possible employment, the employee must recuse from further\nparticipation in the review of the application. When the employee has authority to ask a colleague to\nassume reviewing responsibilities, they may accomplish recusal by transferring the work to the\ncolleague. However, to ensure that the colleague and others with whom they had been working on\nthe review do not seek their advice regarding the review of the application or otherwise involve them\nin the matter, it may be necessary for the employee to advise those individuals of the recusal.\n(c)\nDocumentation. Employees, other than public filers, need not file written recusal statements unless they\nare required by part 2634 of this chapter to file written evidence of compliance with an ethics agreement\nwith the Office of Government Ethics or a designated agency ethics official, or are specifically directed by\nan agency ethics official or the person responsible for their assignments to file written recusal\nstatements. However, it is often prudent for employees to create a record of their actions by providing\nwritten notice to an agency ethics official, a supervisor, or other appropriate official. Public filers must\ncomply with the documentation requirements set forth in § 2635.607.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c): The General Counsel of a regulatory agency will be engaging in discussions\nregarding possible employment as corporate counsel of a regulated entity. Matters directly affecting\nthe financial interests of the regulated entity are pending within the Office of General Counsel, but\nthe General Counsel will not be called upon to act in any such matter because signature authority for\nthat particular class of matters has been delegated to an Assistant General Counsel. Because the\nGeneral Counsel is responsible for assigning work within the Office of General Counsel, they can, in\nfact, accomplish recusal by simply avoiding any involvement in matters affecting the regulated\nentity. However, because it is likely to be assumed by others that the General Counsel is involved in\nall matters within the cognizance of the Office of General Counsel, they would benefit from filing a\nwritten recusal statement with an agency ethics official or the Commissioners of the regulatory\nagency and providing their subordinates with written notification of the recusal. The General Counsel\nmay also be specifically directed by an agency ethics official or the Commissioners to file a written\nrecusal statement. If the General Counsel is a public filer, they must comply with the documentation\nrequirements set forth in § 2635.607.\n(d)\nAgency determination of substantial conflict. When the agency determines that the employee's action in\nseeking employment with a particular person will require the employee to recuse from matters so central\nor critical to the performance of the employee's official duties that the employee's ability to perform the\nduties of the employee's position would be materially impaired, the agency may allow the employee to\ntake annual leave or leave without pay while seeking employment, or may take other appropriate action.\n(a)",

In addition,\nnothing in this subpart requires an employee, other than a public filer, to notify anyone that the\nemployee is seeking employment unless a notification is necessary to implement a recusal pursuant\nto § 2635.604(b). A public filer who negotiates for or has an agreement of future employment or\ncompensation must comply with the notification requirements in § 2635.607. An employee may,\nhowever, be subject to other statutes that impose requirements on employment contacts or\ndiscussions, such as 41 U.S.C. 2103, which is applicable to agency officials involved in certain\nprocurement matters. Employees are encouraged to consult with their ethics officials if they have\nany questions about how this subpart may apply to them. Ethics officials are not obligated by this\nsubpart to inform supervisors that employees are seeking employment.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): Recently, an employee of the Department of Education submitted a resume to\nthe University of Delaware for a job opening. The employee has begun seeking employment.\nHowever, because the employee is not participating in any particular matters affecting the University\nof Delaware, there is no requirement that anyone be notified that the employee has begun seeking\nemployment.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): The employee in example 1 to this paragraph (a) has been approached about\nan employment opportunity at the University of Maryland. Because the University of Maryland has\napplied for grants on which the employee has been assigned to work in the past, the employee\nwants to make certain that they do not violate the ethics rules. The employee contacts an ethics\nofficial to discuss the matter. The employee informs the ethics official that they are not currently\nparticipating in any particular matters affecting the University of Maryland. As a result, the ethics\nofficial advises the employee that they will have no notification obligations under this subpart.\nHowever, the ethics official cautions the employee that, if the employee is assigned to participate in\na particular matter affecting the University of Maryland while they are seeking employment with the\nUniversity, they must take whatever steps are necessary to avoid working on the grant, in accordance\nwith § 2635.604.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.602\n5 CFR 2635.602(a) “Example 2 to paragraph (a)” (enhanced display)\npage 46 of 90\n§ 2635.603 Definitions.\nFor purposes of this subpart:\n(b)\nRelated restrictions —\n(1)\nOutside employment while a Federal employee. An employee who is contemplating outside\nemployment to be undertaken concurrently with the employee's Federal employment must abide by\nany limitations applicable to the employee's outside activities under subparts G and H of this part,\nincluding any requirements under supplemental agency regulations to obtain prior approval before\nengaging in outside employment or activities and any prohibitions under supplemental agency\nregulations related to outside employment or activities. The employee must also comply with any\napplicable recusal requirement of this subpart, as well as any applicable recusal requirements under\nsubpart D or E of this part as a result of the employee's outside employment activities.\n(2)\nPost-employment restrictions. An employee who is contemplating employment to be undertaken\nfollowing the termination of the employee's Federal employment should consult an agency ethics\nofficial to obtain advice regarding any post-employment restrictions that may be applicable. The\nregulation implementing the Governmentwide post-employment statute, 18 U.S.C. 207, is contained\nin part 2641 of this chapter. Employees are cautioned that they may be subject to additional\nstatutory prohibitions on post-employment acceptance of compensation from contractors, such as\n41 U.S.C. 2104.\n(3)\nInterview trips and entertainment. When a prospective employer who is a prohibited source as\ndefined in § 2635.203(d) offers to reimburse an employee's travel expenses, or provide other\nreasonable amenities incident to employment discussions, the employee may accept such\namenities in accordance with § 2635.204(e)(3). When a prospective employer is a foreign\ngovernment or international organization, the employee must also comply with the Foreign Gifts and\nDecorations Act, 5 U.S.C. 7342.\n(a)\nEmployment means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision\nof personal services by the employee, whether to be undertaken at the same time as or subsequent to\nFederal employment. It includes but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee,\nagent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who has announced their intention\nto retire is approached by Tribal representatives concerning a possible consulting contract with the\ntribe. The contractual relationship the tribe wishes to negotiate is employment for purposes of this\nsubpart.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Department of Health and Human Services is invited to a\nmeeting with officials of a nonprofit corporation to discuss the possibility of serving as a member of\nthe corporation's board of directors.

While no actual harm has occurred yet, the implication of mandatory contributions could create an uncomfortable work environment and lead to further violations if not addressed.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n- **5 CFR 2635.302(a)**: Prohibits employees from giving or contributing to a gift for an official superior and from soliciting contributions for such gifts.\n- **5 CFR 2635.304(c)**: Allows for voluntary contributions for gifts on special occasions, but these must be clearly communicated as voluntary, and employees must feel free to contribute less or nothing at all.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Criminal Penalties**: Violations of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) could lead to criminal charges if it is determined that there was intent to influence an official action.\n- **Civil Penalties**: Employees may face fines or other civil penalties if found in violation of federal ethics laws.\n- **Administrative Consequences**: Potential disciplinary actions from the agency, including reprimands, suspension, or termination, depending on the severity and frequency of the violations.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Address the Situation**: Speak to the colleague who suggested the specific amount and clarify that contributions must be voluntary and that no one should feel pressured to contribute.\n2. **Communicate with the Team**: Send a message to the team reiterating that contributions for the farewell gift are voluntary and that any suggested amounts should be accompanied by a statement allowing for lesser contributions or no contribution at all.\n3. **Consult with Ethics Officer**: If unsure about the situation, consult with the agency's ethics officer for guidance on how to proceed.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- **Notify Ethics Officer**: Report the situation to the agency's ethics officer immediately to seek advice and document the incident.\n- **Documentation**: Keep a record of communications regarding the gift collection and any discussions with colleagues about contributions.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n- **Training**: Organize ethics training sessions for the team to reinforce the importance of voluntary contributions and the prohibition against coercion.\n- **Clear Guidelines**: Develop and distribute clear guidelines regarding gift-giving and contributions within the agency to ensure all employees understand their rights and responsibilities.\n- **Encourage Open Communication**: Foster an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns without fear of retaliation.\n\n## Additional Context\n- **Precedents**: The example provided in the regulations (5 CFR 2635.304(c)) indicates that while contributions for gifts are permissible, they must be voluntary and not imply coercion. The situation described mirrors previous cases where improper solicitation led to disciplinary actions.\n- **Agency Culture**: As a senior contractor at the Department of Defense, it is crucial to model ethical behavior and ensure that all team members understand the importance of compliance with federal ethics regulations.",

However, subordinates may take up a collection and\nemployees may contribute a nominal amount to buy refreshments to be consumed by everyone in\nthe immediate office to mark either such occasion.\nExample 4 to paragraph (c): Subordinates may each contribute a nominal amount to a fund to give a gift to\nan official superior upon the occasion of that superior's transfer or promotion to a position outside\nthe organization.\nExample 5 to paragraph (c): An Assistant Secretary at the Department of the Interior is getting married. The\nAssistant Secretary's assistant has decided that a microwave oven would be a nice gift from the\nstaff and has informed each of the Assistant Secretary's subordinates that they should contribute $5\nfor the gift. The assistant's method of collection is improper. Although it is permissible to\nrecommend a $5 contribution, the recommendation must be coupled with a statement that the\nemployee whose contribution is solicited is free to contribute less or nothing at all.\n(a)\nStatutory prohibition. An employee is prohibited by criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. 208(a), from participating\npersonally and substantially in an official capacity in any particular matter in which, to the employee's\nknowledge, the employee or any person whose interests are imputed to the employee under this statute\nhas a financial interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable effect on that interest.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.304(c) “Example 4 to paragraph (c)”\n5 CFR 2635.402(a) (enhanced display)\npage 31 of 90\naccordance with paragraph (c) of this section or obtain a waiver or determine that an exemption\napplies, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.\nNote 2 to paragraph (b)(1): If a particular matter involves a specific party or parties,\ngenerally the matter will at most only have a direct and predictable effect, for purposes\nof this subpart, on a financial interest of the employee in or with a party, such as the\nemployee's interest by virtue of owning stock. There may, however, be some situations in\nwhich, under the standards of this paragraph (b)(1), a particular matter will have a direct\nand predictable effect on an employee's financial interests in or with a nonparty. For\nexample, if a party is a corporation, a particular matter may also have a direct and\npredictable effect on an employee's financial interests through ownership of stock in an\naffiliate, parent, or subsidiary of that party. Similarly, the disposition of a protest against\nthe award of a contract to a particular company may also have a direct and predictable\neffect on an employee's financial interest in another company listed as a subcontractor\nin the proposal of one of the competing offerors.\n(b)\nDefinitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\nDirect and predictable effect.\n(i)\nA particular matter will have a direct effect on a financial interest if there is a close causal link\nbetween any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect of the matter\non the financial interest. An effect may be direct even though it does not occur immediately. A\nparticular matter will not have a direct effect on a financial interest, however, if the chain of\ncausation is attenuated or is contingent upon the occurrence of events that are speculative or\nthat are independent of, and unrelated to, the matter. A particular matter that has an effect on a\nfinancial interest only as a consequence of its effects on the general economy does not have a\ndirect effect within the meaning of this subpart.\n(ii)\nA particular matter will have a predictable effect if there is a real, as opposed to a speculative\npossibility that the matter will affect the financial interest. It is not necessary, however, that the\nmagnitude of the gain or loss be known, and the dollar amount of the gain or loss is immaterial.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b)(1): An employee of the National Library of Medicine at the National\nInstitutes of Health has just been asked to serve on the technical evaluation panel to review\nproposals for a new library computer search system. DEF Computer Corporation, a closely held\ncompany in which the employee and their spouse own a majority of the stock, has submitted a\nproposal. Because award of the systems contract to DEF or to any other offeror will have a\ndirect and predictable effect on the financial interests of both the employee and the spouse, the\nemployee cannot participate on the technical evaluation team unless this disqualification has\nbeen waived.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b)(1): Upon assignment to the technical evaluation panel, the employee in\nexample 1 to this paragraph (b)(1) finds that DEF Computer Corporation has not submitted a\nproposal.

As a farewell party, 12\nsubordinates have decided to take the supervisory employee out to lunch at a restaurant. It is\nunderstood that the employees will pay for their own meals and that the cost of the supervisor's\nlunch will be divided equally among the 12. Even though the amount they will contribute is not\ndetermined until the supervisor orders lunch, the contribution made by those who choose to\nparticipate in the farewell lunch is voluntary.\n(a)\nGeneral exceptions. On an occasional basis, including any occasion on which gifts are traditionally given\nor exchanged, the following may be given to an official superior or accepted from a subordinate or an\nemployee receiving less pay:\n(1)\nItems, other than cash, with an aggregate market value of $10 or less per occasion;\n(2)\nItems such as food and refreshments to be shared in the office among several employees;\n(3)\nPersonal hospitality provided at a residence which is of a type and value customarily provided by the\nemployee to personal friends;\n(4)\nItems given in connection with the receipt of personal hospitality if of a type and value customarily\ngiven on such occasions; and\n(5)\nUnless obtained in violation of § 630.912 of this title, leave transferred under subpart I of part 630 of\nthis title to an employee who is not an immediate supervisor.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): Upon returning to work following a vacation at the beach, a claims examiner\nwith the Department of Veterans Affairs may give their supervisor, and the supervisor may accept, a\nbag of saltwater taffy purchased on the boardwalk for $8.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation whose bank\nexamination responsibilities require frequent travel may not bring their supervisor, and the supervisor\nmay not accept, souvenir coffee mugs from each of the cities the employee visits in the course of\nperforming examination duties, even though each of the mugs costs less than $5.

This subpart summarizes\nthe relevant statutory restrictions and some of the regulatory guidance found there. Specifically, this subpart\ncontains two provisions relating to financial interests. One is a recusal requirement and the other is a prohibition on\nacquiring or continuing to hold specific financial interests. An employee may acquire or hold any financial interest\nnot prohibited by § 2635.403. Notwithstanding that the acquisition or holding of a particular interest is proper, an\nemployee is prohibited in accordance with § 2635.402 from participating in an official capacity in any particular\nmatter in which, to the employee's knowledge, the employee or any person whose interests are imputed to the\nemployee has a financial interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable effect on that interest.\n§ 2635.402 Disqualifying financial interests.\nNote 1 to paragraph (a): Standards applicable when seeking non-Federal employment are\ncontained in subpart F of this part and, if followed, will ensure that an employee does not violate\n18 U.S.C. 208(a) or this section when the employee is negotiating for or has an arrangement\nconcerning future employment. In all other cases when the employee's participation would violate\n18 U.S.C. 208(a), an employee must recuse from participating in the particular matter in\nmeaning of paragraph (b) of this section. However, subordinates may take up a collection and\nemployees may contribute a nominal amount to buy refreshments to be consumed by everyone in\nthe immediate office to mark either such occasion.\nExample 4 to paragraph (c): Subordinates may each contribute a nominal amount to a fund to give a gift to\nan official superior upon the occasion of that superior's transfer or promotion to a position outside\nthe organization.\nExample 5 to paragraph (c): An Assistant Secretary at the Department of the Interior is getting married.

To comply with this section, the employee must either\npromptly return the barometer or pay the donor the market value of the gift. Alternatively, the\nNational Park Service may choose to accept the gift if permitted under specific statutory gift\nacceptance authority. The employee may not destroy this gift, as the market value is in excess\nof $100.\n(2)\nGifts of perishable items. When it is not practical to return a tangible item in accordance with\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section because the item is perishable, the employee may, at the discretion\nof the employee's supervisor or the agency designee, give the item to an appropriate charity, share\nthe item within the recipient's office, or destroy the item.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a)(2): With approval by the recipient's supervisor, a floral arrangement sent by\na disability claimant to a helpful employee of the Social Security Administration may be placed\nin the office's reception area.\n(3)\nGifts of intangibles. The employee must promptly reimburse the donor the market value for any\nentertainment, favor, service, benefit, or other intangible.

Employees also are prohibited\nfrom soliciting a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior. In addition, employees are\nprohibited from accepting a gift from an employee who receives less pay. The prohibitions in this subpart apply\nunless the item is excluded from the definition of a gift (see § 2635.303(a)) or falls within one of the exceptions set\nforth in this subpart. Gifts from outside sources are subject to the limitations set forth in subpart B of this part.\n§ 2635.302 General standards.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a)(3): A Department of Defense employee wishes to attend a charitable event\nfor which they were offered a $300 ticket by a prohibited source. Although attendance is not in\nthe interest of the agency under § 2635.204(g), the employee may attend if they reimburse the\ndonor the $300 face value of the ticket.\n(4)\nGifts from foreign governments or international organizations. The employee must dispose of gifts\nfrom foreign governments or international organizations in accordance with 41 CFR part 102-42.\n(b)\nAn agency may authorize disposition or return of gifts at Government expense. Employees may use\npenalty mail to forward reimbursements required or permitted by this section.\n(c)\nEmployees who, on their own initiative, promptly comply with the requirements of this section will not be\ndeemed to have improperly accepted an unsolicited gift. Employees who promptly consult their agency\nethics official to determine whether acceptance of an unsolicited gift is proper and who, upon the advice\nof the ethics official, return the gift or otherwise dispose of the gift in accordance with this section, will be\nconsidered to have complied with the requirements of this section on the employee's own initiative.\n(d)\nEmployees are encouraged to record any actions they have taken to properly dispose of gifts that cannot\nbe accepted under this subpart, such as by sending an electronic mail message to the appropriate agency\nethics official or the employee's supervisor.\n(a)\nGifts to superiors. Except as provided in this subpart, employees may not:\n(1)\nDirectly or indirectly, give a gift to or make a contribution toward a gift for an official superior, and an\nofficial superior may not knowingly accept such a gift; or\n(2)\nSolicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to either their own or the other employee's\nofficial superior.\n(b)\nGifts from employees receiving less pay. Except as provided in this subpart, employees may not, directly or\nindirectly, accept a gift from an employee who receives less pay unless:\n(1)\nThere is a personal relationship between the two employees that would justify the gift and the\nemployee receiving the gift is not the official superior of the employee giving the gift; or\n(2)\nThe employee giving the gift is the official superior of the employee receiving the gift.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.206(a)(3) “Example 1 to paragraph (a)(3)”",

The GS-15 employee recently accepted a position at DHS, and in the new\nposition will be the direct supervisor of the GS-13 employee. Although the personal relationship\nbetween the two employees justified the gift of rent-free use of the vacation home before they were\nboth employed at DHS, for the duration of their supervisor-subordinate relationship the GS-13\nemployee may not allow the GS-15 neighbor to use the vacation house rent-free or give other gifts,\nexcept as permitted by the exceptions contained in this subpart.\n(c)\nLimitation on use of exceptions. Notwithstanding any exception provided in this subpart, an official\nsuperior may not coerce the offering of a gift from a subordinate.\n(a)\nGift has the meaning set forth in § 2635.203(b). For purposes of § 2635.203(b) and this paragraph (a) an\nemployee will be deemed to have paid market value for any benefit received as a result of participating in\na carpool or other such mutual arrangement between employees if the employee bears a fair proportion\nof the expense or effort involved.\n(b)\nIndirectly, for purposes of § 2635.302(b), has the meaning set forth in § 2635.203(f). For purposes of §\n2635.302(a), it includes a gift:\n(1)\nGiven with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence by the employee's parent, sibling, spouse,\nchild, or dependent relative; or\n(2)\nGiven by a person other than the employee when circumstances indicate that the employee has\npromised or agreed to reimburse that person or to give that person something of value in exchange\nfor giving the gift.\n(c)\nMarket value has the meaning set forth in § 2635.203(c), subject to paragraph (a) of this section.\n(d)\nOfficial superior means any other employee, other than the President and the Vice President, including but\nnot limited to an immediate supervisor, whose official responsibilities include directing or evaluating the\nperformance of the employee's official duties or those of any other official superior of the employee.

A contribution is\nnot voluntary unless it is made in an amount determined by the contributing employee, except that when\nan amount for a gift is included in the cost for a luncheon, reception, or similar event, an employee who\nfreely chooses to pay a proportionate share of the total cost in order to attend will be deemed to have\nmade a voluntary contribution. Except in the case of contributions for a gift included in the cost of a\nluncheon, reception, or similar event, a statement that an employee may choose to contribute less or not\nat all must accompany any recommendation of an amount to be contributed for a gift to an official\nsuperior.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.302(b) “Example 1 to paragraph (b)”\n5 CFR 2635.303(f) (enhanced display)\npage 28 of 90\n§ 2635.304 Exceptions.\nThe prohibitions set forth in § 2635.302(a) and (b) do not apply to a gift given or accepted under the circumstances\ndescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

The firm did not offer the partnership position the\nemployee sought. Even though the employee is no longer seeking employment with the firm, they\nmay continue to be recused from participating in the investigation based on a determination by the\nagency designee that the concern that a reasonable person might question whether, in view of the\nhistory of the employment negotiations, they could act impartially in the matter outweighs the\nGovernment's interest in their participation.\n(a)\nNotification regarding negotiations for or agreement of future employment or compensation. A public filer\nwho is negotiating for or has an agreement of future employment or compensation with a non-Federal\nentity must file a statement notifying an agency ethics official of such negotiation or agreement within\nthree business days after commencement of the negotiation or agreement. This notification statement\nmust be in writing, must be signed by the public filer, and must include the name of the non-Federal entity\ninvolved in such negotiation or agreement and the date on which the negotiation or agreement\ncommenced. When a public filer has previously complied with the notification requirement in this section\nregarding the commencement of negotiations, the filer need not file a separate notification statement\nwhen an agreement of future employment or compensation is reached with the previously identified non-\nFederal entity. There is also no requirement to file another notification when negotiations have been\nunsuccessful. However, employees may want to do so to facilitate the resumption of their duties.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Merit Systems Protection Board who is a public filer was in\nprivate practice prior to Government service. The employee receives a telephone call from a partner\nin a law firm who inquires as to whether they would be interested in returning to private practice.\nDuring this initial telephone call with the law firm partner, the employee indicates that they are\ninterested in resuming private practice. The partner and employee discuss generally the types of\nissues that would need to be agreed upon if the employee were to consider a possible offer to serve\nas “of counsel” with the firm, such as salary, benefits, and type of work the employee would perform.\nThe employee has begun negotiating for future employment with the law firm. Within three business\ndays after this initial telephone call, the employee must file written notification of the negotiations\nwith the agency ethics official.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): The employee in the example 1 to this paragraph (a) also negotiates a possible\ncontract with a publisher to begin writing a textbook after leaving Government service. Within three\nbusiness days after commencing negotiations, the employee must file written notification with the\nagency ethics official documenting this engagement in negotiations for future compensation with\nthe book publisher.\n(b)\nNotification of recusal. A public filer who files a notification statement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this\nsection must file with an agency ethics official a notification of recusal whenever there is a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of interest with the non-Federal entity identified in the notification\nstatement. The notification statement and the recusal statement may be contained in a single document\nor in separate documents.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch"

This could impair your ability to perform your duties impartially.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n1. **18 U.S.C. § 208** - Prohibits federal employees from participating in matters that would affect their financial interests.\n2. **5 CFR § 2635.403** - Prohibits holding financial interests that create a conflict of interest.\n3. **5 CFR § 2635.402(e)** - States that an employee who divests before obtaining a certificate of divestiture will not be eligible for special tax treatment.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Criminal Penalties**: Violating 18 U.S.C. § 208 can lead to fines and imprisonment.\n- **Civil Penalties**: Potential for civil fines and restitution.\n- **Administrative Consequences**: Disciplinary actions, including suspension or termination from federal service.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Divest Your Stock**: Sell your stock in the financial services company immediately.\n2. **Obtain a Certificate of Divestiture**: Apply for a certificate of divestiture to defer tax consequences.\n3. **Notify Your Supervisor**: Proactively disclose your financial interest and potential conflict of interest to your supervisor.\n4. **Consult with Ethics Official**: Seek guidance from your agency's ethics official to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- **Notify**: Your immediate supervisor and the agency's ethics official.\n- **Deadline**: As soon as possible, ideally before your promotion consideration.\n- **Forms Needed**: Complete any required forms for divestiture and for applying for a certificate of divestiture.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n1. **Regular Ethics Training**: Participate in ongoing ethics training to stay informed about potential conflicts of interest.\n2. **Financial Disclosure**: Regularly update your financial disclosure forms to reflect any changes in your financial interests.\n3. **Consultation**: Before accepting any new position or promotion, consult with your agency's ethics official regarding potential conflicts.\n\n## Additional Context\nGiven your senior executive position at the Treasury, the implications of holding stock in a financial services company are significant. The agency's supplemental regulations specifically prohibit such holdings to maintain public confidence in the impartiality of its regulatory functions. Past cases have shown that failure to disclose conflicts can lead to severe repercussions, including loss of employment.

      "to defer the tax consequences of divestiture under part 2634, subpart J, of this chapter. An employee\nwho divests before obtaining a certificate of divestiture will not be eligible for this special tax\ntreatment.\n(f)\nOfficial duties that give rise to potential conflicts. When their official duties create a substantial likelihood\nthat they may be assigned to a particular matter from which they would be required to recuse, employees\nshould advise their supervisors or other persons responsible for their assignments of that potential so\nthat conflicting assignments can be avoided, consistent with the agency's needs.\n(a)\nAgency regulation prohibiting certain financial interests. An agency may, by supplemental agency\nregulation, prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a financial interest or a class of financial\ninterests by agency employees, or any category of agency employees, and the spouses and minor\nchildren of those employees, based on the agency's determination that the acquisition or holding of such\nfinancial interests would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which\nagency programs are administered. When the agency restricts or prohibits the holding of certain financial\ninterests by its employees' spouses or minor children, any such prohibition or restriction must be based\non a determination that there is a direct and appropriate nexus between the prohibition or restriction as\napplied to spouses and minor children and the efficiency of the service.\n(b)\nAgency determination of substantial conflict. An agency may prohibit or restrict an individual employee\nfrom acquiring or holding a financial interest or a class of financial interests based upon the agency\ndesignee's determination that the holding of such interest or interests will:\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.402(e)\n5 CFR 2635.403(b) (enhanced display)\npage 36 of 90\n(1)\nRequire the employee to recuse from particular matters so central or critical to the performance of\nthe employee's official duties that their ability to perform the duties of their position would be\nmaterially impaired; or\n(2)\nAdversely affect the efficient accomplishment of the agency's mission because another employee\ncannot be readily assigned to perform work from which the employee would be recused by reason of\nthe financial interest.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An Air Force employee who owns $33,778 of stock in a major aircraft engine\nmanufacturer is being considered for promotion to a position that involves responsibility for\ndevelopment of a new fighter airplane. If the agency determined that engineering and other\ndecisions about the Air Force's requirements for the fighter would directly and predictably affect the\nemployee's financial interests, the employee could not, by virtue of 18 U.S.C. 208(a), perform these\nsignificant duties of the position while retaining stock in the company. The agency can require the\nemployee to sell the stock as a condition of being selected for the position rather than allowing the\nemployee to recuse from particular matters.\n(c)\nDefinition of financial interest. For purposes of this section:\n(1)\nExcept as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term financial interest is limited to financial\ninterests that are owned by the employee or by the employee's spouse or minor children. However,\nthe term is not limited to only those financial interests that would require the employee to recuse\nunder 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and § 2635.402. The term includes any current or contingent ownership,\nequity, or security interest in real or personal property or a business, and may include an\nindebtedness or compensated employment relationship. It thus includes, for example, interests in\nthe nature of stocks, bonds, partnership interests, fee and leasehold interests, mineral and other\nproperty rights, deeds of trust, and liens, and extends to any right to purchase or acquire any such\ninterest, such as a stock option or commodity future. It does not include a future interest created by\nsomeone other than the employee, the employee's spouse, or minor child, or any right as a\nbeneficiary of an estate that has not been settled.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c)(1): A regulatory agency has concluded that ownership by its employees of\nstock in entities regulated by the agency would significantly diminish public confidence in the\nagency's performance of its regulatory functions and thereby interfere with the\naccomplishment of its mission. In its supplemental agency regulations, the agency may\nprohibit its employees from acquiring or continuing to hold stock in regulated entities.\nExample 2 to paragraph (c)(1): An agency that insures bank deposits may, by supplemental agency\nregulation, prohibit its employees who are bank examiners from obtaining loans from banks\nthey examine. Examination of a member bank could have no effect on an employee's fixed\nobligation to repay a loan from that bank and, thus, would not affect an employee's financial\ninterests so as to require recusal under § 2635.402. Nevertheless, a loan from a member bank\nis a discrete financial interest within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section that may,\nwhen appropriate, be prohibited by supplemental agency regulation.\n(2)\nThe term financial interest includes service, with or without compensation, as an officer, director,\ntrustee, general partner, or employee of any person, including a nonprofit entity, whose financial\ninterests are imputed to the employee under § 2635.402(b)(2)(iii) or (iv).",

Under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2), regulatory exemptions of general applicability\nhave been issued by the Office of Government Ethics, based on its determination that particular\ninterests are too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of employees to\nwhom those exemptions apply. See part 2640, subpart B of this chapter.\n(2)\nIndividual waivers. An individual waiver enabling the employee to participate in one or more particular\nmatters may be issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) if, in advance of the employee's participation:\n(i)\nThe employee:\n(A)\nAdvises the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment (or other\nGovernment official to whom authority to issue such a waiver for the employee has been\ndelegated) about the nature and circumstances of the particular matter or matters; and\n(B)\nMakes full disclosure to such official of the nature and extent of the relevant financial\ninterest; and\n(ii)\nSuch official determines, in writing, that the employee's financial interest in the particular matter\nor matters is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services\nwhich the Government may expect from such employee. See part 2640, subpart C of this\nchapter (providing additional guidance).\n(3)\nFederal advisory committee member waivers. An individual waiver may be issued under 18 U.S.C.\n208(b)(3) to a special Government employee serving on, or under consideration for appointment to,\nan advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act if the Government\nofficial responsible for the employee's appointment (or other Government official to whom authority\nto issue such a waiver for the employee has been delegated):\n(i)\nReviews the financial disclosure report filed by the special Government employee pursuant to 5\nU.S.C. chapter 131; and\n(ii)\nCertifies in writing that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a\nconflict of interest created by the relevant financial interest. See part 2640, subpart C, of this\nchapter (providing additional guidance).\n(4)\nConsultation and notification regarding waivers. When practicable, an official is required to consult\nformally or informally with the Office of Government Ethics prior to granting a waiver referred to in\nparagraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. A copy of each such waiver is to be forwarded to the Director\nof the Office of Government Ethics.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.402(d)\n5 CFR 2635.402(d)(4) (enhanced display)\npage 35 of 90\n§ 2635.403 Prohibited financial interests.\nAn employee may not acquire or hold any financial interest that agency employees are prohibited from acquiring or\nholding by statute, by agency regulation issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or by reason of an\nagency determination of substantial conflict under paragraph (b) of this section.\nNote 1 to paragraph (a): There is no statute of Governmentwide applicability prohibiting\nemployees from holding or acquiring any financial interest. Statutory restrictions, if any, are\ncontained in agency statutes which, in some cases, may be implemented by agency regulations\nissued independent of this part.\n(e)\nDivestiture of a disqualifying financial interest. Upon sale or other divestiture of the asset or other interest\nthat would otherwise require the employee to recuse from participating in a particular matter, 18 U.S.C.\n208(a) and paragraph (c) of this section will no longer prohibit the employee's participation in the matter.\n(1)\nVoluntary divestiture. An employee who would otherwise be required to recuse from participating in a\nparticular matter may voluntarily sell or otherwise divest the interest that create the recusal\nrequirement.\n(2)\nDirected divestiture. An employee may be required to sell or otherwise divest the disqualifying\nfinancial interest if the continued holding of that interest is prohibited by statute or by agency\nsupplemental regulation issued in accordance with § 2635.403(a), or if the agency determines in\naccordance with § 2635.403(b) that a substantial conflict exists between the financial interest and\nthe employee's duties or accomplishment of the agency's mission.\n(3)\nEligibility for special tax treatment. An employee who is directed to divest an interest may be eligible\nto defer the tax consequences of divestiture under part 2634, subpart J, of this chapter. An employee\nwho divests before obtaining a certificate of divestiture will not be eligible for this special tax\ntreatment.\n(f)\nOfficial duties that give rise to potential conflicts.

Whenever an agency directs divestiture of a financial interest\nunder paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the employee will be given a reasonable period of time,\nconsidering the nature of their particular duties and the nature and marketability of the interest, within\nwhich to comply with the agency's direction. Except in cases of unusual hardship, as determined by the\nagency, a reasonable period must not exceed 90 days from the date divestiture is first directed. However,\nas long as the employee continues to hold the financial interest, all restrictions imposed by this subpart\nremain applicable.\n(e)\nEligibility for special tax treatment. Employees required to sell or otherwise divest a financial interest may\nbe eligible to defer the tax consequences of divestiture under part 2634, subpart J, of this chapter.\n(a)\nScope. This subpart is intended to ensure that employees take appropriate steps to avoid an appearance\nof loss of impartiality in the performance of their official duties in circumstances other than those covered\nby the criminal conflict of interest statute, 18 U.S.C. 208(a).\n(1)\nThe provisions of § 2635.502 are designed to help employees identify and take appropriate steps\nregarding their participation in particular matters involving specific parties that may cause a\nreasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question their impartiality. Employees and\nagencies should analyze such appearance issues, and employees may receive authorization to\nparticipate in such matters, using the procedures in this subpart.\n(2)\nUnder § 2635.503, an employee who has received a covered payment from a former employer is\nsubject, in the absence of a waiver pursuant to § 2635.503(c), to a two-year period of recusal from\nparticipating in particular matters in which that former employer is or represents a party.\n(3)\nAn employee is prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) from participating personally and substantially in an\nofficial capacity in any particular matter in which, to the employee's knowledge, the employee has a\npersonal or imputed financial interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable effect\non that interest. Section 208(a), its interpreting and implementing regulations under part 2640 of this\nchapter, and the regulations at subparts D and F of this part, apply when the particular matter would\naffect the financial interests of one of these persons.\n(b)\nDistinction between authorizations under this subpart and waivers and exemptions under the criminal\nconflict of interest law.\n(1)\nWhen an employee's participation in a particular matter involving specific parties would raise a\nquestion in the mind of a reasonable person about the employee's impartiality, but would not violate\n18 U.S.C. 208(a), the agency designee may make a determination, as explained in § 2635.502(d),\nand authorize the employee to participate in the matter.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.403(d)\n5 CFR 2635.501(b)(1) (enhanced display)\npage 38 of 90\nNote 1 to § 2635.501: Even if the employee or agency designee determines that this subpart is not\napplicable, the employee's supervisor or other individuals responsible for assigning work to the",

Stock own-\n ership is one example. If you or your \n spouse or minor child owned $30,000 \n of stock in a company that would be \n affected by your job duties, you would \n not be able to perform those duties \n until certain measures are taken to re-\n solve the conflict. This would be true \n even if the extent of the gain or loss is \n small or isn’t known.\n Keep in mind, however, that conflicts \n can arise from interests other than \n stock. For example, if you are on the \n board of directors of an organization, \n you could not act on a grant or con-\n tract that would benefit that organiza-\n tion.\n In some cases, the law recognizes that \n your financial interest may be so re-\n mote or inconsequential that the inter-\n est should not prevent you from being \n involved in a particular assignment. \n However, your agency may also have \n additional restrictions that prohibit \n you from holding certain interests or \n outside positions.\n If you think you might have a conflict-\n ing financial interest, you should dis-\n cuss it with your supervisor or your \n ethics official. They can provide you \n with guidance to address the conflict. \n This might include not working on the \n Government matter, selling stocks, or \n resigning from an outside position. \n Your ethics official will be able to as-\n sist you with your particular circum-\n stances.\n ETHICAL CONDUCT    -  7  -    LAWS\n Examples of conflicting financial interests restrictions:\n •  Rachel’s husband works for a contractor that has a contract \n with her agency.

When the agency determines that the employee's action in\nseeking employment with a particular person will require the employee to recuse from matters so central\nor critical to the performance of the employee's official duties that the employee's ability to perform the\nduties of the employee's position would be materially impaired, the agency may allow the employee to\ntake annual leave or leave without pay while seeking employment, or may take other appropriate action.\n(a)\nWaiver. When, as defined in § 2635.603(b)(1)(i), an employee is engaged in employment negotiations for\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. 208(a), the employee may not participate personally and substantially in a\nparticular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect on the financial\ninterests of a prospective employer. The employee may participate in such matters only when the\nemployee has received a written waiver issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (3). These\nwaivers are described in § 2635.402(d) and part 2640, subpart C, of this chapter. For certain employees, a\nregulatory exemption under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2) may also apply (see part 2640, subpart B,\nof this chapter, including § 2640.203(g) and (i)).\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.604(b) “Example 2 to paragraph (b)”\n5 CFR 2635.605(a) (enhanced display)\npage 52 of 90\n§ 2635.606 Recusal based on an arrangement concerning prospective employment or\notherwise after negotiations.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Department of Agriculture is negotiating for employment\nwithin the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and § 2635.603(b)(1)(i) with an orange grower. In the\nabsence of a written waiver issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1), the employee may not take official\naction on a complaint filed by a competitor alleging that the grower has shipped oranges in violation\nof applicable quotas.\n(b)\nAuthorization by agency designee. When an employee is seeking employment within the meaning of §\n2635.603(b)(1)(ii) or (iii) and is not negotiating for employment, a reasonable person would be likely to\nquestion the employee's impartiality if the employee were to participate personally and substantially in a\nparticular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect on the financial\ninterests of any such prospective employer. The employee may participate in such matters only when the\nagency designee has authorized in writing the employee's participation in accordance with the standards\nset forth in § 2635.502(d).\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): Within the past month, an employee of the Department of Education mailed a\nresume to a university. The employee is thus seeking employment with the university within the\nmeaning of § 2635.603(b)(1)(ii). In the absence of specific authorization by the agency designee in\naccordance with § 2635.502(d), the employee may not participate personally and substantially in an\nassignment to review a grant application submitted by the university.\n(a)\nEmployment or arrangement concerning employment. An employee may not participate personally and\nsubstantially in a particular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect\non the financial interests of the person by whom the employee is employed or with whom the employee\nhas an arrangement concerning future employment, unless authorized to participate in the matter by a\nwritten waiver issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (3), or by a regulatory exemption under\nthe authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2). These waivers and exemptions are described in § 2635.402(d) and\npart 2640, subparts B and C, of this chapter.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): A military officer has accepted a job with a defense contractor that will begin\nsix months after retirement from military service. During the remainder of Government employment,\nthe officer may not participate personally and substantially in the administration of a contract with\nthat particular defense contractor unless a written waiver is issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C.\n208(b)(1).\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): An accountant has just been offered a job with the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) which involves a two-year limited appointment. The accountant's private\nemployer, a large corporation, believes the job will enhance their skills and has agreed to give them a\ntwo-year unpaid leave of absence at the end of which they have agreed to return to work for the\ncorporation.

However, you should consult with your agency's designated ethics official to confirm that the organization meets the necessary criteria.\n\n## Severity Level\n**No Violation** - The acceptance of pro bono legal services from a nonprofit organization that does not have interests substantially affected by your official duties is permissible under federal ethics regulations.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n- **5 CFR § 2635.1009(a)**: Employees may accept pro bono legal services for legal matters arising from their past or current official position, provided the service provider does not have interests that may be substantially affected by the employee's official duties.\n- **5 CFR § 2635.1009(c)**: The designated agency ethics official must determine whether the organization and the attorney meet the requirements for providing pro bono legal services.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Criminal Penalties**: If you were to accept services from an organization with conflicting interests, you could face criminal charges under **18 U.S.C. § 208** for conflicting financial interests.\n- **Civil Penalties**: Violations of ethics regulations can lead to civil penalties, including fines.\n- **Administrative Consequences**: Potential disciplinary actions from your agency, including reprimands or termination.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Consult with the Designated Agency Ethics Official**: Before accepting the pro bono services, discuss the offer with your agency's ethics official to ensure compliance with all regulations.\n2. **Gather Information**: Provide the ethics official with details about the nonprofit organization, including its mission, funding sources, and any potential conflicts of interest.\n3. **Document the Consultation**: Keep a record of your consultation and any guidance provided by the ethics official.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- If you accept the pro bono legal services, you must report this on your financial disclosure report if you are a public or confidential filer under **5 CFR § 2634**.\n- Ensure that you comply with any specific reporting requirements set forth by your agency's ethics office.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n- **Regular Ethics Training**: Participate in ongoing ethics training provided by your agency to stay informed about regulations and compliance requirements.\n- **Consult Before Accepting Offers**: Always consult with your ethics official before accepting any gifts or services that could be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n- **Maintain Transparency**: Keep open lines of communication with your agency's ethics office regarding any potential conflicts or offers of assistance.\n\n## Additional Context\n- **Precedents**: Similar cases have shown that employees can accept pro bono legal services from nonprofit organizations as long as there are no conflicting interests. For example, an employee at the Securities and Exchange Commission was allowed to accept pro bono services from a nonprofit focusing on harassment cases, as neither the organization nor the attorney had interests that could be affected by the employee's duties.\n- **Agency-Specific Guidance**: Each agency may have additional policies regarding the acceptance of pro bono services, so it is crucial to be aware of any specific guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nBy following these guidelines and consulting with your ethics official, you can ensure compliance with federal ethics regulations while addressing your personal legal matter.",

Three months after this contribution was made, the donor\nsubmitted a disability claim. The employee may not participate in evaluating the disability claim\nbecause the claim falls within the two-year mandatory recusal period.\n(3)\nMisuse of position. Legal expense fund payments must be solicited and accepted consistent with the\nprovisions in subpart G of this part relating to the use of public office for private gain, use of\nnonpublic information, use of Government property, and use of Government time. The mere\nreference to the employee's official position in a solicitation would generally not violate subpart G of\nthis part.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c)(3): A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employee retains legal\ncounsel due to an investigation into inappropriate behavior in their department, and the\nemployee establishes a legal expense fund in accordance with this subpart. Neither the\nemployee nor the legal expense fund's trustee may use the TSA agency seal in materials or\notherwise imply the Government endorses the legal expense fund, or use nonpublic details of\nthe investigation to solicit contributions to the legal expense fund. Agency seals frequently are\nprotected by law or require licensing for use. Further, the employee may not task subordinates\nwith any work relating to administration of the legal expense fund. However, the employee may\nnote in a solicitation that they are an employee of TSA, and that the matter arose in the course\nof their official duties.\n(4)\nFinancial disclosure. In addition to the legal expense fund reporting requirements outlined in §\n2635.1007, an employee beneficiary who is a public or confidential filer, other than a confidential filer\nwho is an anonymous whistleblower, under part 2634 of this chapter must report gifts of legal\nexpense payments accepted from sources other than the United States Government, including gifts\nof pro bono services, on the employee's financial disclosure report, subject to applicable thresholds\nand exclusions.\nAnonymous whistleblower means an employee who makes or intends to make a disclosure or report, or who\nengages in an activity protected under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8), 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9), 5 U.S.C. 416, 50 U.S.C.\n3517, 50 U.S.C. 3033, or 28 CFR 27.1, and who seeks to remain anonymous.\nArising in connection with the employee's past or current official position means the employee's involvement in\nthe legal matter would not have arisen had the employee not held the status, authority, or duties\nassociated with the employee's past or current Federal position.\nExample 1 to the definition of “arising in connection with the employee's past or current official position”: A\nDepartment of Transportation employee is being investigated by the Inspector General for potential\nmisuse of Government resources while on official travel. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is separately\ninvestigating the employee for misreporting household income on the employee's personal taxes. The\nemployee may use this subpart to establish a legal expense fund concerning the Inspector General\ninvestigation because the legal matter arose in connection with their official position. However, this\nsubpart would not apply to the unrelated IRS investigation because that legal matter did not arise in\nconnection with the employee's official position.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.1002(c)(2) “Example 1 to paragraph (c)(2)”\n5 CFR 2635.1003 “Example 1 to the definition of “arising in connection with the employee's past or current\npage 79 of\n§ 2635.1004 Establishment.\nExample 2 to the definition of “arising in connection with the employee's past or current official position”: A junior\nemployee at the Environmental Protection Agency is challenging their proposed termination due to\nmisuse of Government property. All of the employee's alleged misconduct occurred outside official duty\nhours. Because the employee would not be subject to the Standards of Conduct had the employee not\nheld their official position, the employee may establish a legal expense fund in accordance with this\nsubpart.\nArising in connection with the employee's prior position on a campaign means the employee's involvement in the",

Stock own-\n ership is one example. If you or your \n spouse or minor child owned $30,000 \n of stock in a company that would be \n affected by your job duties, you would \n not be able to perform those duties \n until certain measures are taken to re-\n solve the conflict. This would be true \n even if the extent of the gain or loss is \n small or isn’t known.\n Keep in mind, however, that conflicts \n can arise from interests other than \n stock. For example, if you are on the \n board of directors of an organization, \n you could not act on a grant or con-\n tract that would benefit that organiza-\n tion.\n In some cases, the law recognizes that \n your financial interest may be so re-\n mote or inconsequential that the inter-\n est should not prevent you from being \n involved in a particular assignment. \n However, your agency may also have \n additional restrictions that prohibit \n you from holding certain interests or \n outside positions.\n If you think you might have a conflict-\n ing financial interest, you should dis-\n cuss it with your supervisor or your \n ethics official. They can provide you \n with guidance to address the conflict. \n This might include not working on the \n Government matter, selling stocks, or \n resigning from an outside position. \n Your ethics official will be able to as-\n sist you with your particular circum-\n stances.\n ETHICAL CONDUCT    -  7  -    LAWS\n Examples of conflicting financial interests restrictions:\n •  Rachel’s husband works for a contractor that has a contract \n with her agency.

If the General Counsel is a public filer, they must comply with the documentation\nrequirements set forth in § 2635.607.\n(d)\nAgency determination of substantial conflict. When the agency determines that the employee's action in\nseeking employment with a particular person will require the employee to recuse from matters so central\nor critical to the performance of the employee's official duties that the employee's ability to perform the\nduties of the employee's position would be materially impaired, the agency may allow the employee to\ntake annual leave or leave without pay while seeking employment, or may take other appropriate action.\n(a)\nWaiver. When, as defined in § 2635.603(b)(1)(i), an employee is engaged in employment negotiations for\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. 208(a), the employee may not participate personally and substantially in a\nparticular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect on the financial\ninterests of a prospective employer. The employee may participate in such matters only when the\nemployee has received a written waiver issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (3). These\nwaivers are described in § 2635.402(d) and part 2640, subpart C, of this chapter. For certain employees, a\nregulatory exemption under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2) may also apply (see part 2640, subpart B,\nof this chapter, including § 2640.203(g) and (i)).\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.604(b) “Example 2 to paragraph (b)”\n5 CFR 2635.605(a) (enhanced display)\npage 52 of 90\n§ 2635.606 Recusal based on an arrangement concerning prospective employment or\notherwise after negotiations.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Department of Agriculture is negotiating for employment\nwithin the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and § 2635.603(b)(1)(i) with an orange grower. In the\nabsence of a written waiver issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1), the employee may not take official\naction on a complaint filed by a competitor alleging that the grower has shipped oranges in violation\nof applicable quotas.\n(b)\nAuthorization by agency designee. When an employee is seeking employment within the meaning of §\n2635.603(b)(1)(ii) or (iii) and is not negotiating for employment, a reasonable person would be likely to\nquestion the employee's impartiality if the employee were to participate personally and substantially in a\nparticular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect on the financial\ninterests of any such prospective employer. The employee may participate in such matters only when the\nagency designee has authorized in writing the employee's participation in accordance with the standards\nset forth in § 2635.502(d).\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): Within the past month, an employee of the Department of Education mailed a\nresume to a university. The employee is thus seeking employment with the university within the\nmeaning of § 2635.603(b)(1)(ii). In the absence of specific authorization by the agency designee in\naccordance with § 2635.502(d), the employee may not participate personally and substantially in an\nassignment to review a grant application submitted by the university.\n(a)\nEmployment or arrangement concerning employment. An employee may not participate personally and\nsubstantially in a particular matter that, to the employee's knowledge, has a direct and predictable effect\non the financial interests of the person by whom the employee is employed or with whom the employee\nhas an arrangement concerning future employment, unless authorized to participate in the matter by a\nwritten waiver issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (3), or by a regulatory exemption under\nthe authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2). These waivers and exemptions are described in § 2635.402(d) and\npart 2640, subparts B and C, of this chapter.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): A military officer has accepted a job with a defense contractor that will begin\nsix months after retirement from military service. During the remainder of Government employment,\nthe officer may not participate personally and substantially in the administration of a contract with\nthat particular defense contractor unless a written waiver is issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C.\n208(b)(1).\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): An accountant has just been offered a job with the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) which involves a two-year limited appointment. The accountant's private\nemployer, a large corporation, believes the job will enhance their skills and has agreed to give them a\ntwo-year unpaid leave of absence at the end of which they have agreed to return to work for the\ncorporation.

      "Example 3 to paragraph (a): A special Government employee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) is assigned to advise the FDIC on rules applicable to all member banks. The employee mails\nan unsolicited letter to a member bank offering services as a contract consultant. Although the\nemployee is seeking employment, the employee may participate in this particular matter of general\napplicability until receipt of some response indicating an interest in discussing the employment\nproposal. A letter merely acknowledging receipt of the proposal is not an indication of interest in\nemployment discussions.\nExample 4 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is\nconducting an inspection of one of several textile companies to which they sent an unsolicited\nresume. The employee may not participate personally and substantially in the inspection because\nthey are seeking employment and the inspection is a particular matter involving specific parties that\nwill affect the textile company.\n(b)\nNotification. Employees who become aware of the need to recuse from participating in a particular matter\nto which they have been assigned must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that they do not\nparticipate in the matter. Appropriate oral or written notification of their recusal may be made to an\nagency ethics official, coworkers, or a supervisor to document and help effectuate the recusal. Public\nfilers must comply with additional notification requirements set forth in § 2635.607.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is participating in the\naudit of a contract for laboratory support services. Before sending a resume to a lab which is a\nsubcontractor under the VA contract, the employee should recuse from participating in the audit.\nBecause the employee cannot withdraw from participating in the contract audit without supervisor\napproval, the employee should notify the supervisor of the need to recuse for ethics reasons so that\nappropriate adjustments in work assignments can be made.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.604(a)(2)(i)\n5 CFR 2635.604(b) “Example 1 to paragraph (b)” (enhanced display)\npage 51 of 90\n§ 2635.605 Waiver or authorization permitting participation while seeking employment.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is contacted in writing\nby a pharmaceutical company concerning possible employment with the company. The employee is\nreviewing an application from the same pharmaceutical company, which is seeking FDA approval for\na new drug product. Once the employee makes a response that is not a rejection to the company's\ncommunication concerning possible employment, the employee must recuse from further\nparticipation in the review of the application. When the employee has authority to ask a colleague to\nassume reviewing responsibilities, they may accomplish recusal by transferring the work to the\ncolleague. However, to ensure that the colleague and others with whom they had been working on\nthe review do not seek their advice regarding the review of the application or otherwise involve them\nin the matter, it may be necessary for the employee to advise those individuals of the recusal.\n(c)\nDocumentation. Employees, other than public filers, need not file written recusal statements unless they\nare required by part 2634 of this chapter to file written evidence of compliance with an ethics agreement\nwith the Office of Government Ethics or a designated agency ethics official, or are specifically directed by\nan agency ethics official or the person responsible for their assignments to file written recusal\nstatements. However, it is often prudent for employees to create a record of their actions by providing\nwritten notice to an agency ethics official, a supervisor, or other appropriate official. Public filers must\ncomply with the documentation requirements set forth in § 2635.607.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c): The General Counsel of a regulatory agency will be engaging in discussions\nregarding possible employment as corporate counsel of a regulated entity. Matters directly affecting\nthe financial interests of the regulated entity are pending within the Office of General Counsel, but\nthe General Counsel will not be called upon to act in any such matter because signature authority for\nthat particular class of matters has been delegated to an Assistant General Counsel. Because the\nGeneral Counsel is responsible for assigning work within the Office of General Counsel, they can, in\nfact, accomplish recusal by simply avoiding any involvement in matters affecting the regulated\nentity. However, because it is likely to be assumed by others that the General Counsel is involved in\nall matters within the cognizance of the Office of General Counsel, they would benefit from filing a\nwritten recusal statement with an agency ethics official or the Commissioners of the regulatory\nagency and providing their subordinates with written notification of the recusal. The General Counsel\nmay also be specifically directed by an agency ethics official or the Commissioners to file a written\nrecusal statement.

The firm did not offer the partnership position the\nemployee sought. Even though the employee is no longer seeking employment with the firm, they\nmay continue to be recused from participating in the investigation based on a determination by the\nagency designee that the concern that a reasonable person might question whether, in view of the\nhistory of the employment negotiations, they could act impartially in the matter outweighs the\nGovernment's interest in their participation.\n(a)\nNotification regarding negotiations for or agreement of future employment or compensation. A public filer\nwho is negotiating for or has an agreement of future employment or compensation with a non-Federal\nentity must file a statement notifying an agency ethics official of such negotiation or agreement within\nthree business days after commencement of the negotiation or agreement. This notification statement\nmust be in writing, must be signed by the public filer, and must include the name of the non-Federal entity\ninvolved in such negotiation or agreement and the date on which the negotiation or agreement\ncommenced. When a public filer has previously complied with the notification requirement in this section\nregarding the commencement of negotiations, the filer need not file a separate notification statement\nwhen an agreement of future employment or compensation is reached with the previously identified non-\nFederal entity. There is also no requirement to file another notification when negotiations have been\nunsuccessful. However, employees may want to do so to facilitate the resumption of their duties.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a): An employee of the Merit Systems Protection Board who is a public filer was in\nprivate practice prior to Government service. The employee receives a telephone call from a partner\nin a law firm who inquires as to whether they would be interested in returning to private practice.\nDuring this initial telephone call with the law firm partner, the employee indicates that they are\ninterested in resuming private practice. The partner and employee discuss generally the types of\nissues that would need to be agreed upon if the employee were to consider a possible offer to serve\nas “of counsel” with the firm, such as salary, benefits, and type of work the employee would perform.\nThe employee has begun negotiating for future employment with the law firm. Within three business\ndays after this initial telephone call, the employee must file written notification of the negotiations\nwith the agency ethics official.\nExample 2 to paragraph (a): The employee in the example 1 to this paragraph (a) also negotiates a possible\ncontract with a publisher to begin writing a textbook after leaving Government service. Within three\nbusiness days after commencing negotiations, the employee must file written notification with the\nagency ethics official documenting this engagement in negotiations for future compensation with\nthe book publisher.\n(b)\nNotification of recusal. A public filer who files a notification statement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this\nsection must file with an agency ethics official a notification of recusal whenever there is a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of interest with the non-Federal entity identified in the notification\nstatement.

See §\n2635.402.\nExample 2 paragraph (d): A new employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission is assigned to an\ninvestigation of insider trading by the brokerage house where they have recently been employed.\nBecause of the sensitivity of the investigation, the agency designee may be unable to conclude that\nthe Government's interest in the employee's participation in the investigation outweighs the concern\nthat a reasonable person may question the integrity of the investigation, even though the employee\nhas severed all financial ties with the company. Based on consideration of all relevant\ncircumstances, the agency designee might determine, however, that it is in the interest of the\nGovernment for the employee to participate in the review of a routine filing by the particular\nbrokerage house.\nExample 3 paragraph (d): An Internal Revenue Service employee involved in a long and complex tax audit\nlearns that their child has just accepted an entry-level management position with a corporation\nwhose taxes are the subject of the audit. Because the audit is essentially complete and because the\nemployee is the only one with an intimate knowledge of the case, the agency designee might\ndetermine, after considering all relevant circumstances, that it is in the Government's interest for the\nemployee to complete the audit, which is subject to additional levels of review.\n(e)\nRecusal. Unless the employee is authorized to participate in the matter under paragraph (d) of this\nsection, an employee may not participate in a particular matter involving specific parties when the\nemployee or the agency designee has concluded, in accordance with paragraph (a) or (c) of this section,\nthat the financial interest of a member of the employee's household, or the role of a person with whom the\nemployee has a covered relationship, is likely to raise a question in the mind of a reasonable person about\nthe employee's impartiality. Recusal is accomplished by not participating in the matter. When the covered\nrelationship is with a former employer, this recusal requirement is for a period of one year after the date of\nthe employee's resignation from the position with the former employer.\n(1)\nNotification. Employees who become aware of the need to recuse from participating in a particular\nmatter involving specific parties to which they have been assigned must take whatever steps are\nnecessary to ensure that they do not participate in the matter. Appropriate oral or written notification\nof their recusal may be made to an agency ethics official, coworkers, or a supervisor to document\nand help effectuate the recusal.\n(2)\nDocumentation. Employees need not file written recusal statements unless they are required by part\n2634 of this chapter to file written evidence of compliance with an ethics agreement with the Office\nof Government Ethics or a designated agency ethics official, or are specifically directed by an agency\nethics official or the person responsible for their assignments to file written recusal statements.\nHowever, it is often prudent for employees to create a record of their actions by providing written\nnotice to an agency ethics official, a supervisor, or other appropriate official.\n(f)\nIrrelevant considerations.

When a public filer is seeking employment within the\nmeaning of § 2635.603(b)(1)(ii) or (iii) or is considering seeking employment, the public filer may elect to\nfile the notification statement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section before negotiations have\ncommenced and before an agreement of future employment or compensation is reached. A public filer\nmay also elect to file the recusal statement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section before the public filer\nhas a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest with the non-Federal entity identified in the\nnotification statement. The public filer need not file the document again upon commencing negotiations\nor reaching an agreement of future employment or compensation. The advance filing of any such\ndocument is not construed as a statement that negotiations have or have not commenced or that a\nconflict of interest does or does not exist. Although the Office of Government Ethics encourages advance\nfiling when a public filer anticipates a realistic possibility of negotiations or an agreement, the failure to\nmake an advance filing does not violate this subpart or the principles of ethical conduct contained in §\n2635.101(b).\nExample 1 to paragraph (c): An employee of the Federal Labor Relations Authority who is a public filer\nbegan negotiating for future employment with a law firm. At the time the employee began\nnegotiating for future employment with the law firm, they were not participating personally and\nsubstantially in a particular matter that, to their knowledge, had a direct and predictable effect on the\nfinancial interest of the law firm. Although the employee was not required to file a recusal statement\nbecause they did not have a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest with the law\nfirm identified in the notification statement, the Office of Government Ethics encourages the\nemployee to submit a notification of recusal at the same time that they file the notification statement\nregarding the negotiations for future employment in order to ensure that the requirement of\nparagraph (b) of this section is satisfied if a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of\ninterest later arises. The agency ethics official should counsel the employee on applicable\nrequirements but is under no obligation to notify the employee's supervisor that the employee is\nnegotiating for employment.\nExample 2 to paragraph (c): An employee of the General Services Administration is contacted by a\nprospective employer regarding scheduling an interview for the following week to begin discussing\nthe possibility of future employment. The employee discusses the matter with the ethics official and\nchooses to file a notification and recusal statement prior to the interview. The notification and\nrecusal statement contain the identity of the prospective employer and an estimated date of when\nthe interview will occur. The employee has complied with the notification requirement of section 17\nof the STOCK Act.\n(d)\nDefinition of agreement of future employment or compensation. Agreement of future employment or\ncompensation for the purposes of this section means any arrangement concerning employment that will\ncommence after the termination of Government service. The term also means any arrangement to\ncompensate in exchange for services that will commence after the termination of Government service.\nThe term includes, among other things, an arrangement to compensate for teaching, speaking, or writing\nthat will commence after the termination of Government service.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.607(c)\n5 CFR 2635.607(d) (enhanced display)\npage 55 of 90\n§ 2635.701 Overview.\nThis subpart contains provisions relating to the proper use of official time and authority, and of information and\nresources to which employees have access because of their Federal employment.

You are required to report such information through the appropriate official channels as mandated by 5 U.S.C. § 13106.\n\n## Severity Level\n**Serious** - Failing to report or disclosing financial interests improperly can lead to significant legal consequences, including civil and criminal penalties.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n1. **5 U.S.C. § 13106** - This statute requires federal employees and contractors to report certain financial interests and imposes penalties for failure to file or for filing false reports.\n2. **18 U.S.C. § 208** - Prohibits federal employees from participating in matters that could affect their financial interests unless they disclose these interests and receive a written determination that they do not pose a conflict.\n3. **5 CFR Part 2635** - Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, which outlines the responsibilities regarding financial interests and conflicts of interest.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n1. **Civil Penalties**: Under 5 U.S.C. § 13106, the Attorney General may bring a civil action against individuals who fail to report or falsify required information, with penalties up to $50,000.\n2. **Criminal Penalties**: Violations of 18 U.S.C. § 208 can result in fines and imprisonment for up to one year.\n3. **Administrative Actions**: Potential disciplinary actions from your agency, including termination or suspension.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Do Not Disclose**: Refrain from sharing any financial information with your colleague.\n2. **Report Financial Interests**: Prepare to report your financial interests through the official channels as required by your agency's ethics office.\n3. **Consult Ethics Official**: Contact your agency's designated ethics official for guidance on how to properly report your financial interests.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n1. **Notify Ethics Office**: Inform your agency's ethics office of the request from your colleague and your intention to report your financial interests.\n2. **Deadline**: Ensure that you report your financial interests within the timeframe specified by your agency's regulations (typically within 30 days of the request or as required by your agency's policies).\n3. **Forms Needed**: Complete any required financial disclosure forms as specified by your agency.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n1. **Training**: Participate in regular ethics training provided by your agency to stay informed about your obligations regarding financial disclosures and conflicts of interest.\n2. **Consultation**: Regularly consult with your agency's ethics office when in doubt about potential conflicts or reporting requirements.\n3. **Documentation**: Keep thorough records of all financial interests and any communications regarding them to ensure compliance and transparency.\n\n## Additional Context\nAs a senior contractor at the Department of Defense with a secret clearance, you are held to high ethical standards. The potential for conflicts of interest is significant in your role, and adherence to reporting requirements is crucial to maintaining the integrity of your position and the agency's operations. Familiarize yourself with your agency's specific regulations regarding financial disclosures, as they may have additional requirements beyond federal law.",

An employee who would otherwise be required to recuse from participating in a\nparticular matter may voluntarily sell or otherwise divest the interest that create the recusal\nrequirement.\n(2)\nDirected divestiture. An employee may be required to sell or otherwise divest the disqualifying\nfinancial interest if the continued holding of that interest is prohibited by statute or by agency\nsupplemental regulation issued in accordance with § 2635.403(a), or if the agency determines in\naccordance with § 2635.403(b) that a substantial conflict exists between the financial interest and\nthe employee's duties or accomplishment of the agency's mission.\n(3)\nEligibility for special tax treatment.

An agency may, by supplemental agency\nregulation, prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a financial interest or a class of financial\ninterests by agency employees, or any category of agency employees, and the spouses and minor\nchildren of those employees, based on the agency's determination that the acquisition or holding of such\nfinancial interests would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which\nagency programs are administered. When the agency restricts or prohibits the holding of certain financial\ninterests by its employees' spouses or minor children, any such prohibition or restriction must be based\non a determination that there is a direct and appropriate nexus between the prohibition or restriction as\napplied to spouses and minor children and the efficiency of the service.\n(b)\nAgency determination of substantial conflict. An agency may prohibit or restrict an individual employee\nfrom acquiring or holding a financial interest or a class of financial interests based upon the agency\ndesignee's determination that the holding of such interest or interests will:\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.402(e)\n5 CFR 2635.403(b) (enhanced display)\npage 36 of 90\n(1)\nRequire the employee to recuse from particular matters so central or critical to the performance of\nthe employee's official duties that their ability to perform the duties of their position would be\nmaterially impaired; or\n(2)\nAdversely affect the efficient accomplishment of the agency's mission because another employee\ncannot be readily assigned to perform work from which the employee would be recused by reason of\nthe financial interest.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An Air Force employee who owns $33,778 of stock in a major aircraft engine\nmanufacturer is being considered for promotion to a position that involves responsibility for\ndevelopment of a new fighter airplane. If the agency determined that engineering and other\ndecisions about the Air Force's requirements for the fighter would directly and predictably affect the\nemployee's financial interests, the employee could not, by virtue of 18 U.S.C. 208(a), perform these\nsignificant duties of the position while retaining stock in the company. The agency can require the\nemployee to sell the stock as a condition of being selected for the position rather than allowing the\nemployee to recuse from particular matters.\n(c)\nDefinition of financial interest. For purposes of this section:\n(1)\nExcept as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term financial interest is limited to financial\ninterests that are owned by the employee or by the employee's spouse or minor children. However,\nthe term is not limited to only those financial interests that would require the employee to recuse\nunder 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and § 2635.402. The term includes any current or contingent ownership,\nequity, or security interest in real or personal property or a business, and may include an\nindebtedness or compensated employment relationship. It thus includes, for example, interests in\nthe nature of stocks, bonds, partnership interests, fee and leasehold interests, mineral and other\nproperty rights, deeds of trust, and liens, and extends to any right to purchase or acquire any such\ninterest, such as a stock option or commodity future. It does not include a future interest created by\nsomeone other than the employee, the employee's spouse, or minor child, or any right as a\nbeneficiary of an estate that has not been settled.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c)(1): A regulatory agency has concluded that ownership by its employees of\nstock in entities regulated by the agency would significantly diminish public confidence in the\nagency's performance of its regulatory functions and thereby interfere with the\naccomplishment of its mission. In its supplemental agency regulations, the agency may\nprohibit its employees from acquiring or continuing to hold stock in regulated entities.\nExample 2 to paragraph (c)(1): An agency that insures bank deposits may, by supplemental agency\nregulation, prohibit its employees who are bank examiners from obtaining loans from banks\nthey examine. Examination of a member bank could have no effect on an employee's fixed\nobligation to repay a loan from that bank and, thus, would not affect an employee's financial\ninterests so as to require recusal under § 2635.402. Nevertheless, a loan from a member bank\nis a discrete financial interest within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section that may,\nwhen appropriate, be prohibited by supplemental agency regulation.\n(2)\nThe term financial interest includes service, with or without compensation, as an officer, director,\ntrustee, general partner, or employee of any person, including a nonprofit entity, whose financial\ninterests are imputed to the employee under § 2635.402(b)(2)(iii) or (iv).",

The employee may not take any action\nto purchase stock in the corporation or its suppliers, and may not advise friends or relatives to do so\nuntil after public announcement of the award. Such actions could violate Federal securities statutes\nas well as this section.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b): A General Services Administration employee involved in evaluating proposals\nfor a construction contract cannot disclose the terms of a competing proposal to a friend employed\nby a company bidding on the work. Prior to award of the contract, bid or proposal information is\nnonpublic information specifically protected by 41 U.S.C. 2102.\nExample 3 to paragraph (b): An employee is a member of a source selection team assigned to review the\nproposals submitted by several companies in response to an Army solicitation for spare parts. As a\nmember of the evaluation team, the employee has access to proprietary information regarding the\nproduction methods of Alpha Corporation, one of the competitors. The employee may not use that\ninformation to assist Beta Company in drafting a proposal to compete for a Navy spare parts\ncontract. The Federal Acquisition Regulation in 48 CFR parts 3, 14, and 15 restricts the release of\ninformation related to procurements and other contractor information that must be protected under\n18 U.S.C. 1905 and 41 U.S.C. 2102.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.702(c) “Example 4 to paragraph (c)”\n5 CFR 2635.703(b) “Example 3 to paragraph (b)” (enhanced display)\npage 58 of 90\n§ 2635.704 Use of Government property.\n§ 2635.705 Use of official time.\nExample 4 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission inadvertently includes a\ndocument that is exempt from disclosure with a group of documents released in response to a\nFreedom of Information Act request. Regardless of whether the document is used improperly, the\nemployee's disclosure does not violate this section because it was not a knowing unauthorized\ndisclosure made for the purpose of furthering a private interest.\nExample 5 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Army Corps of Engineers is actively involved in the\nactivities of an organization whose goals relate to protection of the environment. The employee may\nnot, other than as permitted by agency procedures, give the organization or a newspaper reporter\nnonpublic information about long-range plans to build a particular dam.\n(a)\nStandard. Employees have a duty to protect and conserve Government property and may not use such\nproperty, or allow its use, for other than authorized purposes.\n(b)\nDefinitions. For purposes of this section:\n(1)\nGovernment property includes any form of real or personal property in which the Government has an\nownership, leasehold, or other property interest as well as any right or other intangible interest that is\npurchased with Government funds, including the services of contractor personnel. The term includes\nbut is not limited to office supplies, telephone and other telecommunications equipment and\nservices, Government mail, computers and other electronic devices, printing and reproduction\nfacilities, Government records, Government email and social media accounts, and Government\nvehicles.\n(2)\nAuthorized purposes are those purposes for which Government property is made available to\nmembers of the public or those purposes authorized in accordance with law or regulation.\nAuthorized purposes include but are not limited to those uses of Government property that are in\naccordance with an agency's limited or de minimis personal use policy.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): As permitted under their agency's de minimis personal use policy, an employee\nmay send an email from a Government email account to a former college roommate to schedule\nlunch for the following day.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission whose office\ncomputer provides access to a commercial service providing information for investors may not use\nthat service for personal investment research.\nExample 3 to paragraph (b): In accordance with Office of Personnel Management regulations at part 251 of\nthis title, an attorney employed by the Department of Justice may be permitted to use their office\ncomputer and agency photocopy equipment to prepare a paper to be presented at a conference\nsponsored by a professional association of which they are a member.\n(a)\nUse of an employee's own time.

Accepting payment for providing insights on upcoming EPA regulations would likely violate **18 U.S.C. § 209**, which prohibits federal employees from receiving compensation from non-government sources for performing their official duties.\n\n## Severity Level\n**Serious** - Accepting the consulting fee could lead to significant legal repercussions, including criminal charges, as it directly contravenes federal ethics laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n1. **18 U.S.C. § 209** - Prohibits federal employees from receiving compensation from non-government sources for services related to their official duties.\n2. **5 CFR § 2635.702** - Prohibits the use of nonpublic information for personal gain, which could apply if the insights you provide are based on information not available to the public.\n3. **5 CFR § 2635.201** - General prohibition on soliciting or accepting gifts from prohibited sources, which could include your former colleague's firm if they have interests that may be affected by your official duties.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n1. **Criminal Penalties** - Violating 18 U.S.C. § 209 can result in fines and imprisonment for up to one year.\n2. **Civil Penalties** - You may face civil penalties, including fines up to $50,000 or the amount of compensation received, whichever is greater.\n3. **Administrative Consequences** - Potential disciplinary actions from your agency, including suspension or termination of employment.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Decline the Offer** - Politely inform your former colleague that you cannot accept the consulting fee due to ethical restrictions.\n2. **Document the Interaction** - Keep a record of the offer and your response for your personal records.\n3. **Consult with an Ethics Official** - Reach out to your agency's ethics officer for guidance and to discuss the situation further.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n1. **Notify Your Supervisor** - Inform your immediate supervisor about the offer and your decision to decline it.\n2. **Consult with Ethics Official** - Schedule a meeting with your agency's ethics official to discuss the situation and ensure compliance with all regulations.\n3. **Documentation** - No specific forms are required for reporting this situation, but maintaining a record of your communications is advisable.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n1. **Training** - Participate in regular ethics training provided by your agency to stay informed about compliance requirements.\n2. **Seek Guidance** - Always consult with an ethics official before engaging in any outside employment or consulting opportunities that may relate to your official duties.\n3. **Awareness of Nonpublic Information** - Be vigilant about the use of nonpublic information and ensure that any insights shared are publicly available or do not relate to your official duties.\n\n## Additional Context\nGiven your role as a GS-14 employee at the EPA, you are held to high ethical standards due to the potential impact of your work on public policy and environmental regulations. The agency has strict guidelines to prevent conflicts of interest, and accepting compensation from a private firm for insights related to your official duties could undermine public trust in the agency's integrity. Always prioritize transparency and ethical conduct in your professional interactions.",

      "Protection Agency.” On the same social media account, the EPA employee occasionally discusses\ntopics related to the environment, such as recycling, biking to work, and organic gardening. Even\nthough the employee is discussing matters related to the EPA's mission and lists their position in the\narea designated for occupation, these facts alone would not reasonably be construed as implying\ngovernmental sanction or endorsement. The same employee may not, for example, redesign the\nsocial media account so that it prominently features the official EPA seal and make statements that\neither assert or imply that their opinions on environmental topics are sanctioned or endorsed by the\nGovernment.\n(c)\nEndorsements.

      "agency ethics official is a factor that may be taken into account by the Department of Justice in the\nselection of cases for prosecution. Disclosures made by an employee to an agency ethics official are not\nprotected by an attorney-client privilege. Agency ethics officials are required by 28 U.S.C. 535 to report\nany information they receive relating to a violation of the criminal code, title 18 of the United States Code.\n(a)\nOverview. This subpart contains standards that prohibit an employee from soliciting or accepting any gift\nfrom a prohibited source or any gift given because of the employee's official position, unless the item is\nexcluded from the definition of a gift (see § 2635.203(b)) or falls within one of the exceptions set forth in\nthis subpart.\n(b)\nConsiderations for declining otherwise permissible gifts.\n(1)\nEvery employee has a fundamental responsibility to the United States and its citizens to place loyalty\nto the Constitution, laws, and ethical principles above private gain. An employee's actions should\npromote the public's trust that this responsibility is being met. For this reason, employees should\nconsider declining otherwise permissible gifts if they believe that a reasonable person with\nknowledge of the relevant facts would question the employee's integrity or impartiality as a result of\naccepting the gift.\n(2)\nEmployees who are considering whether acceptance of a gift would lead a reasonable person with\nknowledge of the relevant facts to question their integrity or impartiality may consider, among other\nrelevant factors, whether:\n(i)\nThe gift has a high market value;\n(ii)\nThe timing of the gift creates the appearance that the donor is seeking to influence an official\naction;\n(iii) The gift was provided by a person who has interests that may be substantially affected by the\nperformance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties; and\n(iv) Acceptance of the gift would provide the donor with significantly disproportionate access.\n(3)\nNotwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an employee who accepts a gift that qualifies for\nan exception under § 2635.204 does not violate this subpart or the Principles of Ethical Conduct set\nforth in § 2635.101(b).\n(4)\nEmployees who have questions regarding this subpart, including whether the employee should\ndecline a gift that would otherwise be permitted under an exception found in § 2635.204, should\nseek advice from an agency ethics official.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Peace Corps is in charge of making routine purchases of\noffice supplies. After a promotional presentation to highlight several new products, a vendor offers\nto buy the employee lunch, which costs less than $20. The employee is concerned that a reasonable\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.201\n5 CFR 2635.201(b) “Example 1 to paragraph (b)” (enhanced display)\npage 8 of 90\n§ 2635.202 General prohibition on solicitation or acceptance of gifts.\n§ 2635.203 Definitions.\nFor purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:\nperson may question their impartiality by accepting the free lunch, as the timing of the offer\nindicates that the donor may be seeking to influence an official action and the company has\ninterests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the\nemployee's duties. The employee concludes that appearance considerations weigh against\naccepting the gift.\n(a)\nProhibition on soliciting gifts. Except as provided in this subpart, an employee may not, directly or\nindirectly:\n(1)\nSolicit a gift from a prohibited source; or\n(2)\nSolicit a gift to be given because of the employee's official position.\n(b)\nProhibition on accepting gifts. Except as provided in this subpart, an employee may not, directly or\nindirectly:\n(1)\nAccept a gift from a prohibited source; or\n(2)\nAccept a gift given because of the employee's official position.\n(c)\nRelationship to illegal gratuities statute. A gift accepted pursuant to an exception found in this subpart will\nnot constitute an illegal gratuity otherwise prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 201(c)(1)(B), unless it is accepted in\nreturn for being influenced in the performance of an official act. As more fully described in §\n2635.205(d)(1), an employee may not solicit or accept a gift if to do so would be prohibited by the Federal\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201(b).\nExample 1 to paragraph (c): A Government contractor who specializes in information technology software\nhas offered an employee of the Department of Energy's information technology acquisition division a\n$15 gift card to a local restaurant if the employee will recommend to the agency's contracting officer\nthat the agency select the contractor's products during the next acquisition. Even though the gift\ncard is less than $20, the employee may not accept the gift under § 2635.204(a) because it is\nconditional upon official action by the employee. Pursuant to this paragraph (c) and § 2635.205(a),\nnotwithstanding any exception to the rules in this part, an employee may not accept a gift in return\nfor being influenced in the performance of an official act.\n(a)\nAgency has the meaning set forth in § 2635.102(a).

In addition,\nemployees who file financial disclosure reports should be aware that, subject to\napplicable thresholds and exclusions, travel and travel reimbursements accepted\nfrom sources other than the United States Government must be reported on their\nfinancial disclosure reports.\n(iii) Compensation, for purposes of this paragraph (a):\n(A)\nIncludes any form of consideration, remuneration, or income, including royalties, given for\nor in connection with the employee's teaching, speaking, or writing.\n(B)\nCompensation does not include:\n(1)\nItems offered by any source that could be accepted from a prohibited source under\nsubpart B of this part;\n(2)\nMeals or other incidents of attendance such as waiver of attendance fees or course\nmaterials furnished as part of the event at which the teaching or speaking takes\nplace;\n(3)\nCopies of books or of publications containing articles, reprints of articles, tapes of\nspeeches, and similar items that provide a record of the teaching, speaking, or\nwriting activity; or\n(4)\nTravel expenses for certain individuals as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this\nsection.\n(C)\nFor employees other than covered noncareer employees as defined in § 2636.303(a) of\nthis chapter, compensation does not include travel expenses, consisting of transportation,\nlodging or meals, incurred in connection with the teaching, speaking, or writing activity. For\ncovered noncareer employees as defined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, compensation\ndoes include transportation, lodging, and meals, whether provided in kind, by purchase of\na ticket, by payment in advance, or by reimbursement after the expense has been incurred,\nunless such travel expenses are accepted under specific statutory authority, such as 31\nU.S.C. 1353, 5 U.S.C. 4111, or 5 U.S.C. 7342, or an agency gift acceptance statute.\nExample 1 to paragraph (a)(2)(iii): A GS-15 employee of the Forest Service has developed and\nmarketed, in a private capacity, a speed-reading technique for which popular demand is\ngrowing.

However, you must ensure that the travel expenses and stipend offered do not violate any provisions of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.\n\n## Severity Level\n**No Violation** - Your participation can be compliant with federal ethics laws if you adhere to the guidelines regarding acceptance of travel expenses and ensure that your actions do not imply an intent to influence U.S. foreign policy improperly.\n\n## Legal Foundation\n1. **Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)** - 22 U.S.C. § 612: You are not acting as an agent of a foreign principal if your participation is strictly related to your official duties and does not involve political activities intended to influence U.S. policy.\n2. **Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch** - 5 CFR Part 2635:\n   - **Acceptance of Travel Expenses**: Under 31 U.S.C. § 1353, you may accept travel expenses from non-federal sources if it relates to your official duties and is authorized by your agency.\n   - **Prohibited Compensation**: 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(iii) states that you may not accept compensation for speaking engagements that relate to your official duties, but travel expenses are permissible if properly authorized.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Criminal Penalties**: Violating FARA can lead to fines and imprisonment.\n- **Civil Penalties**: Non-compliance with federal ethics laws can result in civil fines and restitution.\n- **Administrative Consequences**: Disciplinary actions from your agency, including reprimands or termination, may occur for violations of ethical standards.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Consult with Your Agency's Ethics Officer**: Before accepting the invitation, discuss the specifics of the conference and the nature of the stipend and travel expenses.\n2. **Obtain Written Authorization**: If you decide to accept the travel expenses, ensure you have written authorization from your agency that confirms the acceptance is in the agency's interest.\n3. **Document Everything**: Keep records of all communications regarding the invitation, travel expenses, and any authorizations received.\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- **Notify Your Agency's Ethics Office**: Inform them of the invitation and your intent to participate.\n- **File Any Required Forms**: If your agency requires any specific forms for accepting travel expenses, ensure they are completed and submitted in a timely manner.\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n- **Regular Ethics Training**: Participate in ongoing ethics training provided by your agency to stay updated on compliance requirements.\n- **Consultation Before Engagements**: Always consult with your agency's ethics officer before accepting invitations to speak or participate in events that may involve foreign entities.\n- **Clear Policies on Travel and Compensation**: Advocate for clear agency policies regarding the acceptance of travel and compensation from non-federal sources.\n\n## Additional Context\nGiven your senior executive position at the Treasury, it is crucial to maintain transparency and avoid any appearance of impropriety. Your role may attract scrutiny, especially regarding foreign engagements. Ensure that your participation is clearly aligned with your official duties and that you maintain a clear separation between personal and official capacities.",

The speaking\nactivity is related to official duties under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section and the fee\nis prohibited compensation for such speech; travel expenses incurred in connection with\nthe speaking engagement, on the other hand, are not prohibited compensation for a GS-15\nemployee.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(iii)\n5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(iii) “Example 1 to paragraph (a)(2)(iii)” (enhanced display)\npage 68 of 90\nExample 2 to paragraph (a)(2)(iii): Solely because of their recent appointment to a Cabinet-level\nposition, a Government official is invited by the Chief Executive Officer of a major\ninternational corporation to attend, in their personal capacity, firm meetings to be held in\nAspen for the purpose of addressing senior corporate managers on the importance of\nrecreational activities to a balanced lifestyle. The firm offers to reimburse the official's\ntravel expenses. The official may not accept the offer. The speaking activity is related to\nofficial duties under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section and, because the official is a\ncovered noncareer employee as defined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, the travel\nexpenses are prohibited compensation.\nExample 3 to paragraph (a)(2)(iii): A GS-14 attorney at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who\nplayed a lead role in a recently concluded merger case is invited to speak about the case,\nin a private capacity, at a conference in New York. The attorney has no public speaking\nresponsibilities on behalf of the FTC apart from the judicial and administrative\nproceedings to which they are assigned. The sponsors of the conference offer to\nreimburse the attorney for expenses incurred in connection with the travel to New York.\nThey also offer the attorney, as compensation for time and effort, a free trip to San\nFrancisco. The attorney may accept the travel expenses to New York, but not the expenses\nto San Francisco. The lecture relates to official duties under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(E)(1) and\n(2) of this section, but because the attorney is not a covered noncareer employee as\ndefined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, the expenses associated with the travel to New\nYork are not a prohibited form of compensation. The travel expenses to San Francisco, on\nthe other hand, not incurred in connection with the speaking activity, are a prohibited form\nof compensation. If the attorney were a covered noncareer employee, the travel expenses\nto New York as well as the travel expenses to San Francisco would be barred.\nExample 4 to paragraph (a)(2)(iii): An advocacy group dedicated to improving treatments for\nsevere pain asks the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide a conference speaker\nwho can discuss recent advances in the agency's research on pain. The group also offers\nto pay the employee's travel expenses to attend the conference. After performing the\nrequired conflict of interest analysis, NIH authorizes acceptance of the travel expenses\nunder 31 U.S.C. 1353 and the implementing General Services Administration regulation, as\ncodified under 41 CFR chapter 304, and authorizes an employee to undertake the travel. At\nthe conference the advocacy group, as agreed, pays the employee's hotel bill, and provides\nseveral of the employee's meals. Subsequently the group reimburses the agency for the\ncost of the employee's airfare and some additional meals. All of the payments by the\nadvocacy group are permissible. Because the employee is speaking officially and the\nexpense payments are accepted under 31 U.S.C. 1353, they are not prohibited\ncompensation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

If the employee's attendance is determined to be in the interest of\nthe agency and the agency designee provides a written authorization, the employee may accept the\ninvitation from the news organization because more than 100 persons will attend and the cost of the\nticket does not exceed $480. However, if the invitation were extended to the employee and an\naccompanying guest, the employee's guest could not be authorized to attend for free because the\nmarket value of the gift of free attendance would exceed $480.\nExample 5 to paragraph (g): An employee of the Department of Energy (DOE) and their spouse have been\ninvited by a major utility executive to a small dinner party. A few other officials of the utility and their\nspouses or other guests are also invited, as is a representative of a consumer group concerned with\nutility rates and their spouse. The DOE official believes the dinner party will provide an opportunity to\nsocialize with and get to know those in attendance. The employee may not accept the free invitation\nunder this exception, even if attendance could be determined to be in the interest of the agency. The\nsmall dinner party is not a widely attended gathering. Nor could the employee be authorized to\naccept even if the event were instead a corporate banquet to which forty company officials and their\nspouses or other guests were invited. In this second case, notwithstanding the larger number of\npersons expected (as opposed to the small dinner party just noted) and despite the presence of the\nconsumer group representative and spouse who are not officials of the utility, those in attendance\nwould still not represent a diversity of views or interests. Thus, the company banquet would not\nqualify as a widely attended gathering under those circumstances either.\nExample 6 to paragraph (g): An Assistant U.S. Attorney is invited to attend a luncheon meeting of a local bar\nassociation to hear a distinguished judge lecture on cross-examining expert witnesses.

An employee who works as the computer procurement\nofficial for a Government agency could not accept the discount to purchase the personal\ncomputer under the exception in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The employee's\nmembership in the group to which the discount is offered is related to Government employment\nbecause membership is based on the employee's status as a procurement official with the\nGovernment.\nExample 2 to paragraph (c)(2): An employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)\nmay accept a discount of $50 on a microwave oven offered by the manufacturer to all\nmembers of the CPSC employees' association. Even though the CPSC is currently conducting\nstudies on the safety of microwave ovens, the $50 discount is a standard offer that the\nmanufacturer has made broadly available through a number of employee associations and\nsimilar organizations to large segments of the public.\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.204(c)\n5 CFR 2635.204(c)(2) “Example 2 to paragraph (c)(2)” (enhanced display)\npage 16 of 90\nExample 3 to paragraph (c)(2): An Assistant Secretary may not accept a local country club's offer of\nmembership to all members of Department Secretariats which includes a waiver of its $5,000\nmembership initiation fee.

A service member may accept\nfinancial benefits from the relief society, including to cover legal expenses, because the benefits\nare offered by an employee organization that was established before the legal matter arose,\nand because the benefits are being offered because of the employees' Government\nemployment, as set forth in the relief society's governing documents.\n(3)\nAn employee may not accept for personal use any benefit to which the Government is entitled as the\nresult of an expenditure of Government funds, unless authorized by statute or regulation (e.g., 5\nU.S.C. 5702 note, regarding frequent flyer miles).\nExample 1 to paragraph (c)(3): The administrative officer for a field office of U.S. Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) has signed an order to purchase 50 boxes of photocopy paper\nfrom a supplier whose literature advertises that it will give a free briefcase to anyone who\npurchases 50 or more boxes.

As part of its “Work-Life Balance” program, the\nbank has given each employee in the accountant's division two tickets to a professional basketball\ngame and has urged each to invite a family member or friend to share the evening of entertainment.\nUnder the circumstances, the FDIC employee may accept the invitation to attend the game. Even\nthough the tickets were initially purchased by the member bank, they were given without reservation\nto the accountant to use as desired, and the invitation to the employee was motivated by their\npersonal friendship.\nExample 2 to paragraph (b): Three partners in a law firm that handles corporate mergers have invited an\nemployee of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to join them in a golf tournament at a private club\nat the firm's expense.

The employee cannot accept the gift of\none-quarter of the entry fee even though the employee has developed an amicable relationship with\nthe three partners as a result of the firm's dealings with the FTC. As evidenced in part by the fact that\nthe fees are to be paid by the firm, it is not a personal friendship but a business relationship that is\nthe motivation behind the partners' gift.\nExample 3 to paragraph (b): A Peace Corps employee enjoys using a social media site on the internet in a\npersonal capacity outside of work. The employee has used the site to keep in touch with friends,\nneighbors, coworkers, professional contacts, and other individuals they have met over the years\nthrough both work and personal activities. One of these individuals works for a contractor that\nprovides language services to the Peace Corps. The employee was acting in an official capacity\nwhen they met the individual at a meeting to discuss a matter related to the contract between their\nrespective employers.

One day, the\nindividual, whose employer continues to serve as a Peace Corps contractor, contacts the employee\nto offer a pair of concert tickets worth $30 apiece. Although the employee and the individual are\nconnected through social media, the circumstances do not demonstrate that the gift was clearly\nmotivated by a personal relationship, rather than the position of the employee, and therefore the\nemployee may not accept the gift pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n(c)\nDiscounts and similar benefits. In addition to those opportunities and benefits excluded from the definition\nof a gift by § 2635.203(b)(4), an employee may accept:\n(1)\nA reduction or waiver of the fees for membership or other fees for participation in organization\nactivities offered to all Government employees or all uniformed military personnel by professional\norganizations if the only restrictions on membership relate to professional qualifications; and\n(2)\nOpportunities and benefits, including favorable rates, commercial discounts, and free attendance or\nparticipation not precluded by paragraph (c)(3) of this section:\n(i)\nOffered to members of a group or class in which membership is unrelated to Government\nemployment;\n(ii)\nOffered to members of an organization, such as an employees' association or agency credit\nunion, in which membership is related to Government employment if the same offer is broadly\navailable to large segments of the public through organizations of similar size;\n(iii) Offered by a person who is not a prohibited source to any group or class that is not defined in a\nmanner that specifically discriminates among Government employees on the basis of type of\nofficial responsibility or on a basis that favors those of higher rank or rate of pay; or\n(iv) Offered to employees by an established employee organization, such as an association\ncomposed of Federal employees or a nonprofit employee welfare organization, because of the\nemployees' Government employment, so long as the employee is part of the class of\nindividuals eligible for assistance from the employee organization as set forth in the\norganization's governing documents.\nExample 1 to paragraph (c)(2): A computer company offers a discount on the purchase of computer\nequipment to all public and private sector computer procurement officials who work in\norganizations with over 300 employees.

      "agency ethics official is a factor that may be taken into account by the Department of Justice in the\nselection of cases for prosecution. Disclosures made by an employee to an agency ethics official are not\nprotected by an attorney-client privilege. Agency ethics officials are required by 28 U.S.C. 535 to report\nany information they receive relating to a violation of the criminal code, title 18 of the United States Code.\n(a)\nOverview. This subpart contains standards that prohibit an employee from soliciting or accepting any gift\nfrom a prohibited source or any gift given because of the employee's official position, unless the item is\nexcluded from the definition of a gift (see § 2635.203(b)) or falls within one of the exceptions set forth in\nthis subpart.\n(b)\nConsiderations for declining otherwise permissible gifts.\n(1)\nEvery employee has a fundamental responsibility to the United States and its citizens to place loyalty\nto the Constitution, laws, and ethical principles above private gain. An employee's actions should\npromote the public's trust that this responsibility is being met. For this reason, employees should\nconsider declining otherwise permissible gifts if they believe that a reasonable person with\nknowledge of the relevant facts would question the employee's integrity or impartiality as a result of\naccepting the gift.\n(2)\nEmployees who are considering whether acceptance of a gift would lead a reasonable person with\nknowledge of the relevant facts to question their integrity or impartiality may consider, among other\nrelevant factors, whether:\n(i)\nThe gift has a high market value;\n(ii)\nThe timing of the gift creates the appearance that the donor is seeking to influence an official\naction;\n(iii) The gift was provided by a person who has interests that may be substantially affected by the\nperformance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties; and\n(iv) Acceptance of the gift would provide the donor with significantly disproportionate access.\n(3)\nNotwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an employee who accepts a gift that qualifies for\nan exception under § 2635.204 does not violate this subpart or the Principles of Ethical Conduct set\nforth in § 2635.101(b).\n(4)\nEmployees who have questions regarding this subpart, including whether the employee should\ndecline a gift that would otherwise be permitted under an exception found in § 2635.204, should\nseek advice from an agency ethics official.\nExample 1 to paragraph (b): An employee of the Peace Corps is in charge of making routine purchases of\noffice supplies. After a promotional presentation to highlight several new products, a vendor offers\nto buy the employee lunch, which costs less than $20. The employee is concerned that a reasonable\n5 CFR Part 2635 (up to date as of 7/31/2025)\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\n5 CFR 2635.201\n5 CFR 2635.201(b) “Example 1 to paragraph (b)” (enhanced display)\npage 8 of 90\n§ 2635.202 General prohibition on solicitation or acceptance of gifts.\n§ 2635.203 Definitions.\nFor purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:\nperson may question their impartiality by accepting the free lunch, as the timing of the offer\nindicates that the donor may be seeking to influence an official action and the company has\ninterests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the\nemployee's duties. The employee concludes that appearance considerations weigh against\naccepting the gift.\n(a)\nProhibition on soliciting gifts. Except as provided in this subpart, an employee may not, directly or\nindirectly:\n(1)\nSolicit a gift from a prohibited source; or\n(2)\nSolicit a gift to be given because of the employee's official position.\n(b)\nProhibition on accepting gifts. Except as provided in this subpart, an employee may not, directly or\nindirectly:\n(1)\nAccept a gift from a prohibited source; or\n(2)\nAccept a gift given because of the employee's official position.\n(c)\nRelationship to illegal gratuities statute. A gift accepted pursuant to an exception found in this subpart will\nnot constitute an illegal gratuity otherwise prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 201(c)(1)(B), unless it is accepted in\nreturn for being influenced in the performance of an official act. As more fully described in §\n2635.205(d)(1), an employee may not solicit or accept a gift if to do so would be prohibited by the Federal\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201(b).\nExample 1 to paragraph (c): A Government contractor who specializes in information technology software\nhas offered an employee of the Department of Energy's information technology acquisition division a\n$15 gift card to a local restaurant if the employee will recommend to the agency's contracting officer\nthat the agency select the contractor's products during the next acquisition. Even though the gift\ncard is less than $20, the employee may not accept the gift under § 2635.204(a) because it is\nconditional upon official action by the employee. Pursuant to this paragraph (c) and § 2635.205(a),\nnotwithstanding any exception to the rules in this part, an employee may not accept a gift in return\nfor being influenced in the performance of an official act.\n(a)\nAgency has the meaning set forth in § 2635.102(a).

In \n other words, no one other than the United States can pay you for doing your official \n Government duties. \n Section 209 is intended to prevent divided loyalty and even the appearance of \n wrongdoing. Consequently, the prohibition applies even if the person paying \n you has no dealings or relations with your agency, and even if the Government \n experiences no injury as a result of the supplementation.\n The prohibition does not apply to:\n •  special Government employees and employees serving without compensation;\n •  payments made by the treasury of any State, county, or municipality;\n •  continued participation in a former employer’s bona fide employee welfare \n or benefit plan  (such as a pension, retirement, group life, health or accident \n insurance, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan);\n •  payments from a tax-exempt nonprofit organization for travel, subsistence \n and other expenses incurred in connection with training; and\n •  payments for moving expenses incurred in connection with participation in \n an executive exchange or fellowship program in an executive agency.\n ETHICAL CONDUCT    -  11  -    LAWS\n Examples of supplementation of salary restrictions:\n •  Janice was a highly paid executive of a corporation. \n After entering Government service, she could not \n accept an offer from her former employer to pay her \n the difference between her Government salary and the \n compensation she would have received in her former \n position in the corporation.\n •  Neil is a professor at a university.
