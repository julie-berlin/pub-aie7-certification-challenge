    "ground_truth": "# Ethics Assessment\n\n## Direct Answer\nNo, you cannot accept a gift worth $25 from a contractor your agency works with. This violates **5 CFR 2635.202** - Standards of Ethical Conduct regarding gifts from prohibited sources.\n\n## Severity Level\n**Moderate** - This represents a clear violation of federal gift rules with potential disciplinary consequences, though not the most serious category of ethics violation.\n\n## Legal Foundation\nFederal employees are prohibited from accepting gifts from \"prohibited sources\" under 5 CFR 2635.202. Contractors doing business with your agency are prohibited sources. The $20 de minimis exception does not apply here because:\n- The gift value ($25) exceeds the $20 threshold\n- Contractors are prohibited sources regardless of gift value\n- No exceptions apply to this scenario\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Administrative**: Disciplinary action up to and including removal from federal service\n- **Civil**: Potential civil penalties and disgorgement of gift value\n- **Criminal**: If part of broader corruption scheme, could face criminal charges under 18 USC 201\n- **Career Impact**: Negative performance evaluations, loss of security clearance eligibility\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Decline the gift immediately** - Do not accept or keep the gift\n2. **Report to ethics official** - Notify your designated agency ethics official within 24-48 hours\n3. **Document the incident** - Write down details of the offer, when, where, and by whom\n4. **Avoid future contact** - Maintain appropriate professional boundaries with the contractor\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- **Who to notify**: Your immediate supervisor and designated agency ethics official\n- **Timeline**: Report within 24-48 hours of the offer\n- **Documentation**: Submit written report detailing the circumstances\n- **Follow-up**: Cooperate with any investigation or review process\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n- Review your agency's ethics training materials on gift acceptance\n- Maintain clear professional boundaries with contractors\n- When in doubt about any gift offer, consult ethics official before accepting\n- Understand that contractor relationships require extra scrutiny under ethics rules\n\n## Additional Context\nAs a GS-12 employee at GSA, you have regular interaction with contractors. It's essential to maintain the highest ethical standards to preserve public trust in government procurement processes."

    "question": "I work for the Department of Defense and my spouse wants to apply for a job at a defense contractor. Is this allowed?",
    "user_context": {
      "role": "federal_employee", 
      "agency": "DOD",
      "seniority": "GS-14"
    },
    "ground_truth": "# Ethics Assessment\n\n## Direct Answer\nYour spouse may apply for a job at a defense contractor, but you must proactively manage potential conflicts of interest under **5 CFR 2635.502** and DOD-specific ethics regulations.\n\n## Severity Level\n**Minor** - This situation is manageable with proper disclosure and recusal procedures, though requires ongoing attention to avoid conflicts.\n\n## Legal Foundation\nUnder 5 CFR 2635.502, federal employees must avoid conflicts of interest and disqualify themselves from matters affecting their spouse's financial interests. DOD Directive 5500.07 provides additional guidance for defense contractor relationships. The spouse's employment is not prohibited, but creates ongoing obligations for you.\n\n## Potential Penalties\n- **Administrative**: Disciplinary action if conflicts are not properly managed\n- **Career Impact**: Potential limitations on assignments involving the contractor\n- **Criminal**: Only if you participate in matters benefiting the contractor without proper recusal\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Notify your supervisor** - Inform your immediate supervisor of the potential employment\n2. **Contact ethics official** - Discuss recusal requirements and documentation needs\n3. **Document the situation** - Create written record of the disclosure and any recusal agreements\n4. **Review current duties** - Identify any existing matters involving the contractor\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- **Who to notify**: Immediate supervisor and DOD ethics counselor\n- **Timeline**: Before spouse begins employment process\n- **Documentation**: File appropriate recusal statements and conflict disclosures\n- **Ongoing**: Update as circumstances change\n\n## Prevention Strategy\n- Establish clear recusal procedures for any matters involving the contractor\n- Maintain awareness of contractor's business relationships with DOD\n- Regular consultation with ethics office as situations evolve\n- Consider career impact when making decisions about assignments\n\n## Additional Context\nAs a GS-14 DOD employee, you likely have significant decision-making authority. The defense contractor industry has extensive relationships with DOD, so careful management of this situation is essential for maintaining ethical standards."
