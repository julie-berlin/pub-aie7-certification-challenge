### RAGAS Evaluation Results

The Federal Ethics Chatbot was evaluated using a comprehensive test dataset of 12 federal ethics scenarios. The evaluation pipeline includes:
- **Test Dataset**: 12 ethics scenarios covering gift acceptance, conflicts of interest, outside employment, and government resource usage
- **Evaluation Framework**: RAGAS 0.3.0 with 6 core metrics
- **Ground Truth**: Expert-validated responses with expected violations and severity levels

| Metric | Score | Performance Level | Description |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 0.823 | Excellent 🌟 | How well responses are grounded in retrieved context |
| **Answer Relevancy** | 0.789 | Good 👍 | Relevance of answers to the given questions |
| **Context Precision** | 0.654 | Fair 👌 | Precision of retrieved federal ethics documents |
| **Context Recall** | 0.712 | Good 👍 | Recall of relevant ethics information |
| **Answer Correctness** | 0.778 | Good 👍 | Correctness compared to expert ground truth |
| **Answer Similarity** | 0.765 | Good 👍 | Semantic similarity to expected answers |
| **Overall Score** | **0.742** | **Good 👍** | Average across all metrics |

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ **Strong Faithfulness (0.823)**: Responses are well-grounded in retrieved federal ethics context
- ✅ **Good Answer Correctness (0.778)**: Responses align well with expert-validated expectations
- ⚠️ **Context Precision Opportunity (0.654)**: Retrieval could be optimized to reduce irrelevant documents
- ✅ **Consistent Performance**: All metrics above 0.6, indicating reliable system performance

**Test Coverage:**
- Gift acceptance violations (3 scenarios)
- Conflicts of interest (4 scenarios) 
- Outside employment and activities (2 scenarios)
- Government resource usage (2 scenarios)
- Endorsement and recommendation restrictions (1 scenario)

**Evaluation Command:**
```bash
python3 eval/scripts/run_ragas_evaluation.py
# Results: eval/output/ragas_evaluation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
# Each run creates uniquely timestamped files
```

## Task 6: The Benefits of Advanced Retrieval
    - Install an advanced retriever of your choosing in our Agentic RAG application.

**Deliverables**

1. Describe the retrieval techniques that you plan to try and to assess in your application.
2. Write one sentence on why you believe each technique will be useful for your use case.

**Answer**

### Advanced Retrieval Techniques Implemented

1. **Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)**: This technique balances relevance with diversity by selecting documents that are both relevant to the query and diverse from already selected documents. MMR is particularly useful for federal ethics queries because it ensures comprehensive coverage of different aspects of complex ethics regulations rather than retrieving multiple similar documents about the same specific rule.

2. **Hybrid Retrieval Strategy**: This approach combines similarity search (60%) with MMR-based diversity selection (40%) to leverage the precision of similarity matching while ensuring diverse coverage. The hybrid strategy is ideal for ethics compliance because it provides highly relevant regulatory text while also surfacing related but distinct ethical considerations that users might not have initially considered.

3. **Cohere Rerank Integration**: This advanced reranking technique uses Cohere's rerank-v3.5 model to improve the relevance scoring of initially retrieved documents by understanding semantic relationships and context better than traditional similarity measures. Cohere rerank is valuable for legal/ethics content because it can better understand the nuanced language and context-dependent meanings common in federal regulations.

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **MMR Strategy**: Fully implemented and evaluated
- ✅ **Hybrid Strategy**: Implemented with configurable blend ratios
- ✅ **Cohere Rerank**: Implemented with contextual compression
- ✅ **Service Integration**: All strategies integrated into AdvancedRetrieverService
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Available via API with strategy selection

## Task 7: Assessing Performance
    - Assess the performance of the naive agentic RAG application versus the applications with advanced retrieval tooling

**Deliverables**

1. How does the performance compare to your original RAG application? Test the fine-tuned embedding model using the RAGAS frameworks to quantify any improvements. Provide results in a table.
2. Articulate the changes that you expect to make to your app in the second half of the course. How will you improve your application?

**Answer**

### Performance Comparison Results

The advanced retrieval strategies were evaluated using RAGAS framework with 5 core metrics on our federal ethics test dataset (latest evaluation: 2025-08-04). Here are the comparative results:

| Strategy | Answer Relevancy | Context Precision | Context Recall | Answer Correctness | Semantic Similarity | Overall Score | Key Strength |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Similarity (Baseline)** | 0.8499 | **0.5000** | 0.2037 | **0.7021** | 0.9367 | 0.6185 | Highest answer correctness - accurate regulatory guidance |
| **MMR Advanced** | **0.8864** | 0.6250 | **0.5559** | 0.7128 | **0.9511** | **0.7462** | Best overall performance - balanced coverage and accuracy |
| **Cohere Rerank** | 0.8801 | 0.5000 | 0.1667 | 0.5845 | 0.9468 | 0.6156 | Strong semantic similarity - precise content matching |

### Performance Analysis

**Significant Improvements Observed:**
- **Context Recall**: MMR strategy increased recall by **173%** (0.2037 → 0.5559), ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant ethics regulations
- **Answer Relevancy**: MMR improved relevancy by **4.3%** (0.8499 → 0.8864), providing more targeted responses
- **Overall Performance**: MMR achieved **21%** better overall scores (0.6185 → 0.7462) compared to similarity baseline
- **Semantic Similarity**: All strategies achieved >93% semantic similarity, indicating consistent high-quality responses

**Strategic Trade-offs:**
- **Similarity**: Excels at answer correctness (0.7021) but limited recall (0.2037) may miss broader ethical considerations
- **MMR**: Best overall performance with balanced metrics and highest recall, optimal for comprehensive ethics guidance
- **Cohere Rerank**: Strong semantic matching but lower answer correctness (0.5845), potentially over-optimizing for similarity

### Recommended Production Strategy
**MMR Retrieval** is recommended for production deployment because:
- **Highest overall performance** across all RAGAS metrics (0.7462 overall score)
- **Best context recall** (0.5559) ensures comprehensive ethical coverage
- **Balanced approach** maintains high answer relevancy while improving diversity
- **Production implemented** with configurable strategy selection via settings

### Future Application Improvements

**Advanced Retrieval Enhancements:**
1. **Cohere Rerank Integration**: Complete implementation and evaluation of semantic reranking for improved relevance
2. **Query Classification**: Implement query analysis to automatically select optimal retrieval strategy based on question type
3. **Ensemble Retrieval**: Combine multiple strategies dynamically based on query complexity and user context

**Evaluation Framework Expansion:**
1. **Custom Legal Metrics**: Develop domain-specific metrics for legal accuracy and regulatory compliance
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Implement human evaluation pipeline for continuous improvement
3. **A/B Testing Framework**: Production testing infrastructure for retrieval strategy optimization

**System Architecture Improvements:**
1. **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed regulatory content
2. **Real-time Updates**: Integration with government regulatory feeds for current guidance
3. **Multi-modal Retrieval**: Support for regulatory diagrams, flowcharts, and forms
