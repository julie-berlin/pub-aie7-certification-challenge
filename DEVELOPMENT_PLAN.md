# Federal Ethics Chatbot - Development Plan

## Current Status: Certification Challenge - Final Day (Aug 4, 2025) 🏁

**COMPLETED**:
- ✅ Full-stack application (FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend)
- ✅ Docker deployment with Qdrant integration
- ✅ Document upload and management system
- ✅ Simplified assessment UI with expandable detailed analysis
- ✅ Agentic workflow with parallel web search
- ✅ Basic RAGAS evaluation framework (partial - times out)
- ✅ Initial retriever comparison (similarity vs MMR)

**CRITICAL TODAY**: Complete certification requirements
- ❌ Fix RAGAS timeout issues and Cohere rerank integration
- ❌ Complete retriever strategy comparison and documentation
- ❌ Update production system with optimal retriever
- ❌ Add response streaming and test document upload
- ❌ Final documentation of technical choices

## Architecture Improvements Made

### 🎯 **Production Optimization**
- **Removed reflection step** from both notebook and backend for better performance
- **Streamlined workflow**: collect_context → create_plan → retrieve → parallel_search → assess → finalize
- **Eliminated overhead** of confidence scoring and quality reflection agents

### 🏗️ **Full-Stack Implementation**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with parallel agentic workflow service
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, federal design theme
- **Integration**: Complete API integration with error handling
- **User Experience**: Professional chat interface with context collection
- **Production Features**: Markdown rendering, download functionality, Docker deployment
