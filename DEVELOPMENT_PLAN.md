## PHASE 1: Core Enhancements üöÄ
*Priority: High | Timeline: 1-2 weeks*

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Add user context collection** (industry, seniority level, job title)
  - Create user profile schema
  - Integrate context into violation analysis
  - Customize guidance based on role and industry

- [ ] **Add reflection step** for response quality assurance
  - Implement self-review mechanism
  - Check for correctness and completeness
  - Flag uncertain or incomplete responses

### Search Intelligence
- [ ] **Add planning agent** to formulate targeted web searches
  - Analyze question to identify key search terms
  - Generate multiple search strategies
  - Prioritize government and authoritative sources

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API rate limits**: Implement caching and batching
- **Model hallucination**: Add reflection and validation steps
- **Performance degradation**: Optimize retrieval and implement monitoring

### Legal/Compliance Risks
- **Accuracy concerns**: Expert review process and clear disclaimers
- **Liability issues**: Explicit "not legal advice" warnings
- **Data sensitivity**: No storage of personal information

### Operational Risks
- **User adoption**: Comprehensive training and support
- **Maintenance burden**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Cost management**: Usage monitoring and optimization

---

## Dependencies

### External Services
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o, embeddings)
- Tavily API (web search)
- LangSmith (monitoring)
- Docker infrastructure

### Internal Resources
- Ethics expert validation
- User testing participants
- DevOps support for deployment
- Legal review for compliance
